# View Information and Perform Tasks for the Agents Associated With a Publication (Replication Monitor)
  Replication Monitor provides the **Agents** tab, which includes information about the agents associated with the selected publication. The Distribution Agent and Merge Agent are associated with subscriptions; for more information, see [View Information and Perform Tasks for the Agents Associated With a Subscription &#40;Replication Monitor&#41;](../../../relational-databases/replication/monitor/fbb59d31-2424-4552-9195-0da8d83e755f.md).  
  
 This tab displays information about the following agents:  
  
-   The Snapshot Agent, which is used by all publications.  
  
-   The Log Reader Agent, which is used by all transactional publications.  
  
-   The Queue Reader Agent, which is used by transactional publications enabled for queued updating subscriptions.  
  
 To view more information about the options on this tab, click **Help** on the menu bar. For information about starting Replication Monitor, see [Start the Replication Monitor](../../../relational-databases/replication/monitor/start-the-replication-monitor.md).
