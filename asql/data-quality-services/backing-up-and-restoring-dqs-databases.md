1.  Start Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, and connect to the appropriate SQL Server instance.  
  
2.  In Object Explorer, expand the **Databases** node.  
  
3.  Back up the DQS_STAGING_DATA database. For step-by-step instructions for backing a SQL Server database, see [Create a Full Database Backup &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../relational-databases/backup-restore/create-a-full-database-backup-sql-server.md).  
  
4.  Back up the DQS_PROJECTS database.  
  
5.  Back up the DQS_MAIN database.  
  
6.  Disconnect from the current instance of SQL Server, and connect to the SQL Server instance where you want to restore these databases.  
  
7.  Restore DQS_MAIN database. For step-by-step instructions to restore a SQL Server database, see [Restore a Database Backup Using SSMS](../relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-a-database-backup-using-ssms.md).  
  
8.  Restore the DQS_PROJECTS database.  
  
9. Restore the DQS_STAGING_DATA database.  
  
10. In Object Explorer, right-click the server, and then click **New Query**.  
  
11. In the Query Editor window, copy the following SQL statements, and replace *\<PASSWORD>* with the password that you provided during the DQS installation for the database master key:  
  
    ```  
    USE [DQS_MAIN]  
    GO  
    EXECUTE [internal_core].[RestoreDQDatabases] '<PASSWORD>'  
    GO  
  
    ```  
  
12. Press F5 to execute the statements. Check the **Results** pane to verify that the statements have executed successfully.
