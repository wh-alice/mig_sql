# Managing Memory for In-Memory OLTP
  Memory-optimized tables require that sufficient memory exist to keep all of the rows and indexes in memory. Because memory is a finite resource, it is important that you understand and manage memory usage on your system. The topics in this section cover common memory use and management scenarios.  
  
## In this section  
  
|Section|Description|

|[Estimate Memory Requirements for Memory-Optimized Tables](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/estimate-memory-requirements-for-memory-optimized-tables.md)|Estimate a tableâ€™s memory needs.|  
|[Bind a Database with Memory-Optimized Tables to a Resource Pool](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/bind-a-database-with-memory-optimized-tables-to-a-resource-pool.md)|Step by step walkthrough to bind a database with a resource pool.|  
|[Monitor and Troubleshoot Memory Usage](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/monitor-and-troubleshoot-memory-usage.md)|Tools you can use to monitor your memory usage. Also covers troubleshooting if memory usage gets too high.|  
|[Resolve Out Of Memory Issues](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/resolve-out-of-memory-issues.md)|Steps to recover from an OOM (Out of Memory) situation.|  
|[Restore a Database and Bind it to a Resource Pool](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/restore-a-database-and-bind-it-to-a-resource-pool.md)|Steps to restore an [!INCLUDE[hek_2](../a9retired/includes/hek-2-md.md)] database and bind it to a named resource pool.|
