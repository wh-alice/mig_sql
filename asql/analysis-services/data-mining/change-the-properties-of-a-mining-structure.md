# Change the Properties of a Mining Structure
  There are two kinds of properties on a mining structure, both of which can be modified:  
  
-   Properties of the mining structure that affect the entire structure  
  
-   Properties on individual columns in the structure  
  
 Note that some properties are dependent on other property settings. For example, you cannot set properties that control binning behavior (such as <xref:Microsoft.AnalysisServices.ScalarMiningStructureColumn.DiscretizationMethod%2A> or <xref:Microsoft.AnalysisServices.ScalarMiningStructureColumn.DiscretizationBucketCount%2A>) until you have set the data type of the column to **Discretized**.  
  
 For more information about mining structure properties, see [Mining Structure Columns](../../analysis-services/data-mining/mining-structure-columns.md).  
  
### To change the properties of a mining structure  
  
1.  On the **Mining Structure** tab in Data Mining Designer, right-click either the mining structure or a column in the mining structure, and then select **Properties**.  
  
     The **Properties** window opens on the right side of the screen, if it was not already visible.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, select the value that corresponds to the property that you want to change, and then enter the new value.  
  
     The new value will take effect when you select a different element in the designer.
