# sys.dm_db_persisted_sku_features (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Some features of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] change the way that [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] stores information in the database files. These features are restricted to specific editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. A database that contains these features cannot be moved to an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that does not support them Use the sys.dm_db_persisted_sku_features dynamic management view to list all edition-specific features that are enabled in the current database.  
  
||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [current version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299658)).|  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|feature_name|**sysname**|External name of the feature that is enabled in the database but not supported on the all the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This feature must be removed before the database can be migrated to all available editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|  
|feature_id|**Int**|Feature ID that is associated with the feature. [!INCLUDE[ssInternalOnly](../../../integration-services/data-flow/transformations/includes/ssinternalonly-md.md)].|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires VIEW DATABASE STATE permission on the database.  
  
## Remarks  
 If no features that are restricted by edition are used by the database, the view returns no rows.  
  
 sys.dm_db_persisted_sku_features may list the following database-changing features as restricted to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Enterprise or Developer editions:  
  
-   **ChangeCapture.** Indicates that a database has change data capture enabled. To remove change data capture, use the sys.sp_cdc_disable_db stored procedure.  
  
-   **ColumnStoreIndex.** Indicates that at least one table has an xVelocity memory-optimized columnstore index. To enable a database to be moved to an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] other than Enterprise or Developer, use the [DROP INDEX](../../../t-sql/statements/drop-index-transact-sql.md) or [ALTER INDEX](../../../t-sql/statements/alter-index-transact-sql.md) statement to remove the columnstore index.  
  
    ||  
    |-|  
    |**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [current version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299658)).|  
  
-   **Compression.** Indicates that at least one table or index uses data compression or the vardecimal storage format. To enable a database to be moved to an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] other than Enterprise or Developer, use the [ALTER TABLE](../../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) or [ALTER INDEX](../../../t-sql/statements/alter-index-transact-sql.md) statement to remove data compression. To remove vardecimal storage format, use the sp_tableoption statement.  
  
-   **InMemoryOLTP.** Indicates that the database uses In-Memory OLTP. The database has a MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA filegroup.  
  
    ||  
    |-|  
    |**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [current version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299658)).|  
  
-   **Partitioning.** Indicates that the database contains partitioned tables, partitioned indexes, partition schemes, or partition functions. To enable a database to be moved to an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] other than Enterprise or Developer, it is insufficient to modify the table to be on a single partition. You must remove the partitioned table. If the table contains data, use SWITCH PARTITION to convert each partition into a nonpartitioned table. Then delete the partitioned table, the partition scheme, and the partition function.  
  
-   **TransparentDataEncryption.** Indicates that a database is encrypted by using transparent data encryption. To remove transparent data encryption, use the ALTER DATABASE statement. For more information, see [Transparent Data Encryption &#40;TDE&#41;](../../../relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption-tde.md).  
  
 To determine whether a database uses any features that are restricted to specific editions, execute the following statement in the database:  
  
```  
SELECT feature_name FROM sys.dm_db_persisted_sku_features ;  
GO  
```
