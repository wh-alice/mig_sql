# Dimension Processing Destination
  The Dimension Processing destination loads and processes an [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] dimension. For more information about dimensions, see [Dimensions &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models-olap-logical-dimension-objects/dimensions-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).  
  
 The Dimension Processing destination includes the following features:  
  
-   Options to perform incremental, full, or update processing.  
  
-   Error configuration, to specify whether dimension processing ignores errors or stops after a specified number of errors.  
  
-   Mapping of input columns to columns in dimension tables.  
  
 For more information about processing [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] objects, see [Processing Options and Settings &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/processing-options-and-settings-analysis-services.md).  
  
## Configuration of the Dimension Processing Destination  
 The Dimension Processing destination uses an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] connection manager to connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project or the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] that contains the dimensions the destination processes. For more information, see [Analysis Services Connection Manager](../../integration-services/connection-manager/analysis-services-connection-manager.md).  
  
 This destination has one input. It does not support an error output.  
  
 You can set properties through [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../analysis-services/instances/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer or programmatically.  
  
 For more information about the properties that you can set in the **Dimension Processing Destination Editor** dialog box, click one of the following topics:  
  
-   [Dimension Processing Destination Editor &#40;Connection Manager Page&#41;](../../integration-services/data-flow/dimension-processing-destination-editor-connection-manager-page.md)  
  
-   [Dimension Processing Destination Editor &#40;Mappings Page&#41;](../../integration-services/data-flow/dimension-processing-destination-editor-mappings-page.md)  
  
-   [Dimension Processing Destination Editor &#40;Advanced Page&#41;](../../integration-services/data-flow/dimension-processing-destination-editor-advanced-page.md)  
  
 The **Advanced Editor** dialog box reflects the properties that can be set programmatically. For more information about the properties that you can set in the **Advanced Editor** dialog box or programmatically, click one of the following topic:  
  
-   [Common Properties](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/51973502-5cc6-4125-9fce-e60fa1b7b796)
