# SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) - Release Candidate
Welcome to the current release candidate (17.0 RC2) of SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)!  This release candidate of SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) includes support for [SQL Server vNext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt788653.aspx). 


## Download

SSDT release candidate 17.0 RC2 works side-by-side with our [generally available release &#40;16.x&#41;](../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools--ssdt-.md), but is not recommended for production use.

![download](../ssdt/media/download.png)[ Download DacFx and SqlPackage.exe 17.0 RC2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=835693).  


  
## Release notes

**SSDT:**
- The SSIS OData Source and OData Connection Manager now support connecting to the OData feeds of Microsoft Dynamics AX Online and Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online.
- Amending a clustered index on a view will no longer block deployment.
- Schema comparison strings relating to column encryption will use the proper name rather than the instance name.   


**BI improvements:**

**AS:**
- 17.0 RC 2: SSAS Tabular Projects now introduce a preview of the 1400 compatibility mode, including a new data import and connectivity stack. 1400 mode is available in both Integrated workspace and when working against the SQL Server vNext CTP 1.1 Analysis Services Engine.
- 17.0 RC 2: SSAS Tabular Projects now support an additional set of Data Sources when in Direct Query mode.
- 17.0 RC 2: SSAS Tabular Projects targeting 1400 now expose HideMemberIf and Detail Row Expression, bringing ragged hierarchy and drill-through support to tabular models.
- 17.0 RC 2: Pasted Table experience has been enhanced in SSAS Tabular Projects and allows for larger table imports.
- 17.0 RC 1: SSAS Tabular Projects now allow for "Rely on Referential Integrity". This option can be enabled to tell the AS Engine that the underlying data source does have referential integrity (this modifies the type of query that AS can generate and therefore improves performance).

**RS:**
- 17.0 RC 2: Embeddable RVC Control is now available supporting SSRS 2016
