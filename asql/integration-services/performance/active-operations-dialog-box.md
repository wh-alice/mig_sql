# Active Operations Dialog Box
  Use the **Active Operations** dialog box to view the status of currently running [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] operations on the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] server, such as deployment, validation, and package execution. This data is stored in the SSISDB catalog.
