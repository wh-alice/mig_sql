# sys.dm_tran_locks (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns information about currently active lock manager resources in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. Each row represents a currently active request to the lock manager for a lock that has been granted or is waiting to be granted.  
  
 The columns in the result set are divided into two main groups: resource and request. The resource group describes the resource on which the lock request is being made, and the request group describes the lock request.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To call this from [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name **sys.dm_pdw_nodes_tran_locks**.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**resource_type**|**nvarchar(60)**|Represents the resource type. The value can be one of the following: DATABASE, FILE, OBJECT, PAGE, KEY, EXTENT, RID, APPLICATION, METADATA, HOBT, or ALLOCATION_UNIT.|  
|**resource_subtype**|**nvarchar(60)**|Represents a subtype of **resource_type**. Acquiring a subtype lock without holding a nonsubtyped lock of the parent type is technically valid. Different subtypes do not conflict with each other or with the nonsubtyped parent type. Not all resource types have subtypes.|  
|**resource_database_id**|**int**|ID of the database under which this resource is scoped. All resources handled by the lock manager are scoped by the database ID.|  
|**resource_description**|**nvarchar(256)**|Description of the resource that contains only information that is not available from other resource columns.|  
|**resource_associated_entity_id**|**bigint**|ID of the entity in a database with which a resource is associated. This can be an object ID, Hobt ID, or an Allocation Unit ID, depending on the resource type.|  
|**resource_lock_partition**|**Int**|ID of the lock partition for a partitioned lock resource. The value for nonpartitioned lock resources is 0.|  
|**request_mode**|**nvarchar(60)**|Mode of the request. For granted requests, this is the granted mode; for waiting requests, this is the mode being requested.|  
|**request_type**|**nvarchar(60)**|Request type. The value is LOCK.|  
|**request_status**|**nvarchar(60)**|Current status of this request. Possible values are GRANTED, CONVERT, WAIT, LOW_PRIORITY_CONVERT, LOW_PRIORITY_WAIT, or ABORT_BLOCKERS. For more information about low priority waits and abort blockers, see the *low_priority_lock_wait* section of [ALTER INDEX &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-index-transact-sql.md).|  
|**request_reference_count**|**smallint**|Returns an approximate number of times the same requestor has requested this resource.|  
|**request_lifetime**|**int**|[!INCLUDE[ssInternalOnly](../../integration-services/data-flow/transformations/includes/ssinternalonly-md.md)]|  
|**request_session_id**|**int**|Session ID that currently owns this request. The owning session ID can change for distributed and bound transactions. A value of -2 indicates that the request belongs to an orphaned distributed transaction. A value of -3 indicates that the request belongs to a deferred recovery transaction, such as, a transaction for which a rollback has been deferred at recovery because the rollback could not be completed successfully.|  
|**request_exec_context_id**|**int**|Execution context ID of the process that currently owns this request.|  
|**request_request_id**|**int**|Request ID (batch ID) of the process that currently owns this request. This value will change every time that the active Multiple Active Result Set (MARS) connection for a transaction changes.|  
|**request_owner_type**|**nvarchar(60)**|Entity type that owns the request. Lock manager requests can be owned by a variety of entities. Possible values are:<br /><br /> TRANSACTION = The request is owned by a transaction.<br /><br /> CURSOR = The request is owned by a cursor.<br /><br /> SESSION = The request is owned by a user session.<br /><br /> SHARED_TRANSACTION_WORKSPACE = The request is owned by the shared part of the transaction workspace.<br /><br /> EXCLUSIVE_TRANSACTION_WORKSPACE = The request is owned by the exclusive part of the transaction workspace.<br /><br /> NOTIFICATION_OBJECT = The request is owned by an internal [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] component. This component has requested the lock manager to notify it when another component is waiting to take the lock. The FileTable feature is a component that uses this value.<br /><br /> **Note:** Work spaces are used internally to hold locks for enlisted sessions.|  
|**request_owner_id**|**bigint**|ID of the specific owner of this request.<br /><br /> When a transaction is the owner of the request, this value contains the transaction ID.<br /><br /> When a FileTable is the owner of the request, **request_owner_id** has one of the following values.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> -4 : A FileTable has taken a database lock.<br /><br /> -3 : A FileTable has taken a table lock.<br /><br /> Other value : The value represents a file handle. This value also appears as **fcb_id** in the dynamic management view [sys.dm_filestream_non_transacted_handles &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys.dm-filestream-non-transacted-handles-transact-sql.md).|  
|**request_owner_guid**|**uniqueidentifier**|GUID of the specific owner of this request. This value is only used by a distributed transaction where the value corresponds to the MS DTC GUID for that transaction.|  
|**request_owner_lockspace_id**|**nvarchar(32)**|[!INCLUDE[ssInternalOnly](../../integration-services/data-flow/transformations/includes/ssinternalonly-md.md)] This value represents the lockspace ID of the requestor. The lockspace ID determines whether two requestors are compatible with each other and can be granted locks in modes that would otherwise conflict with one another.|  
|**lock_owner_address**|**varbinary(8)**|Memory address of the internal data structure that is used to track this request. This column can be joined the with **resource_address** column in **sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks**.|  
|**pdw_node_id**|**int**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)]<br /><br /> <br /><br /> The identifier for the node that this distribution is on.|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires VIEW SERVER STATE permission on the server.  
  
## Remarks  
 A granted request status indicates that a lock has been granted on a resource to the requestor. A waiting request indicates that the request has not yet been granted. The following waiting-request types are returned by the **request_status** column:  
  
-   A convert request status indicates that the requestor has already been granted a request for the resource and is currently waiting for an upgrade to the initial request to be granted.  
  
-   A wait request status indicates that the requestor does not currently hold a granted request on the resource.  
  
 Because **sys.dm_tran_locks** is populated from internal lock manager data structures, maintaining this information does not add extra overhead to regular processing. Materializing the view does require access to the lock manager internal data structures. This can have minor effects on the regular processing in the server. These effects should be unnoticeable and should only affect heavily used resources. Because the data in this view corresponds to live lock manager state, the data can change at any time, and rows are added and removed as locks are acquired and released. This view has no historical information.  
  
 Two requests operate on the same resource only if all the resource-group columns are equal.  
  
 You can control the locking of read operations by using the following tools:  
  
-   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL to specify the level of locking for a session. For more information, see [SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/set-transaction-isolation-level-transact-sql.md).  
  
-   Locking table hints to specify the level of locking for an individual reference of a table in a FROM clause. For syntax and restrictions, see [Table Hints &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../Topic/Table%20Hints%20\(Transact-SQL\).md).  
  
 A resource that is running under one session ID can have more than one granted lock. Different entities that are running under one session can each own a lock on the same resource, and the information is displayed in the **request_owner_type** and **request_owner_id** columns that are returned by **sys.dm_tran_locks**. If multiple instances of the same **request_owner_type** exist, the **request_owner_id** column is used to distinguish each instance. For distributed transactions, the **request_owner_type** and the **request_owner_guid** columns will show the different entity information.  
  
 For example, Session S1 owns a shared lock on **Table1**; and transaction T1, which is running under session S1, also owns a shared lock on **Table1**. In this case, the **resource_description** column that is returned by **sys.dm_tran_locks** will show two instances of the same resource. The **request_owner_type** column will show one instance as a session and the other as a transaction. Also, the **resource_owner_id** column will have different values.  
  
 Multiple cursors that run under one session are indistinguishable and are treated as one entity.  
  
 Distributed transactions that are not associated with a session ID value are orphaned transactions and are assigned the session ID value of -2. For more information, see [KILL &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/language-elements/kill-transact-sql.md).

 The following XEvents are related to partition **SWITCH** and online index rebuild. For information about syntax, see [ALTER TABLE &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) and [ALTER INDEX &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-index-transact-sql.md).  
  
-   lock_request_priority_state  
  
-   process_killed_by_abort_blockers  
  
-   ddl_with_wait_at_low_priority  
  
 The existing XEvent **progress_report_online_index_operation** for online index operations was extended by adding **partition_number** and **partition_id**.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using sys.dm_tran_locks with other tools  
 The following example works with a scenario in which an update operation is blocked by another transaction. By using **sys.dm_tran_locks** and other tools, information about locking resources is provided.  
  
```  
USE tempdb;  
GO  
  
-- Create test table and index.  
CREATE TABLE t_lock  
    (  
    c1 int, c2 int  
    );  
GO  
  
CREATE INDEX t_lock_ci on t_lock(c1);  
GO  
  
-- Insert values into test table  
INSERT INTO t_lock VALUES (1, 1);  
INSERT INTO t_lock VALUES (2,2);  
INSERT INTO t_lock VALUES (3,3);  
INSERT INTO t_lock VALUES (4,4);  
INSERT INTO t_lock VALUES (5,5);  
INSERT INTO t_lock VALUES (6,6);  
GO  
  
-- Session 1  
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;  
  
BEGIN TRAN  
    SELECT c1  
        FROM t_lock  
        WITH(holdlock, rowlock);  
  
-- Session 2  
BEGIN TRAN  
    UPDATE t_lock SET c1 = 10  
```  
  
 The following query will display lock information. The value for `<dbid>` should be replaced with the **database_id** from **sys.databases**.  
  
```  
SELECT resource_type, resource_associated_entity_id,  
    request_status, request_mode,request_session_id,  
    resource_description   
    FROM sys.dm_tran_locks  
    WHERE resource_database_id = <dbid>  
```  
  
 The following query returns object information by using `resource_associated_entity_id` from the previous query. This query must be executed while you are connected to the database that contains the object.  
  
```  
SELECT object_name(object_id), *  
    FROM sys.partitions  
    WHERE hobt_id=<resource_associated_entity_id>  
```  
  
 The following query will show blocking information.  
  
```  
SELECT   
        t1.resource_type,  
        t1.resource_database_id,  
        t1.resource_associated_entity_id,  
        t1.request_mode,  
        t1.request_session_id,  
        t2.blocking_session_id  
    FROM sys.dm_tran_locks as t1  
    INNER JOIN sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks as t2  
        ON t1.lock_owner_address = t2.resource_address;  
```  
  
 Release the resources by rolling back the transactions.  
  
```  
-- Session 1  
ROLLBACK;  
GO  
  
-- Session 2  
ROLLBACK;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Linking session information to operating system threads  
 The following example returns information that associates a session ID with a Windows thread ID. The performance of the thread can be monitored in the Windows Performance Monitor. This query does not return session IDs that are currently sleeping.  
  
```  
SELECT STasks.session_id, SThreads.os_thread_id  
    FROM sys.dm_os_tasks AS STasks  
    INNER JOIN sys.dm_os_threads AS SThreads  
        ON STasks.worker_address = SThreads.worker_address  
    WHERE STasks.session_id IS NOT NULL  
    ORDER BY STasks.session_id;  
GO  
```
