# sp_trace_setevent (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Adds or removes an event or event column to a trace. **sp_trace_setevent** may be executed only on existing traces that are stopped (*status* is **0**). An error is returned if this stored procedure is executed on a trace that does not exist or whose *status* is not **0**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)] Use Extended Events instead.

|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [current version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299658)).|

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_trace_setevent [ @traceid = ] trace_id   
          , [ @eventid = ] event_id  
          , [ @columnid = ] column_id  
          , [ @on = ] on  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@traceid=** ] *trace_id*  
 Is the ID of the trace to be modified. *trace_id* is **int**, with no default. The user employs this *trace_id* value to identify, modify, and control the trace.  
  
 [ **@eventid=** ] *event_id*  
 Is the ID of the event to turn on. *event_id* is **int**, with no default.  
  
 This table lists the events that can be added to or removed from a trace.

 **[ @on=]** *on*  
 Specifies whether to turn the event ON (1) or OFF (0). *on* is **bit**, with no default.  
  
 If *on* is set to **1**, and *column_id* is NULL, then the event is set to ON and all columns are cleared. If *column_id* is not null, then the column is set to ON for that event.  
  
 If *on* is set to **0**, and *column_id* is NULL, then the event is turned OFF and all columns are cleared. If *column_id* is not null, then the column is turned OFF.  
  
 This table illustrates the interaction between **@on** and **@columnid**.  
  
|@on|@columnid|Result|  
|---------|---------------|------------|  
|ON (**1**)|NULL|Event is turned ON.<br /><br /> All Columns are cleared.|  
||NOT NULL|Column is turned ON for the specified Event.|  
|OFF (**0**)|NULL|Event is turned OFF.<br /><br /> All Columns are cleared.|  
||NOT NULL|Column is turned OFF for the specified Event.|  
  
## Return Code Values  
 The following table describes the code values that users may get following completion of the stored procedure.  
  
|Return code|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|0|No error.|  
|1|Unknown error.|  
|2|The trace is currently running. Changing the trace at this time will result in an error.|  
|3|The specified event is not valid. The event may not exist or it is not an appropriate one for the store procedure.|  
|4|The specified column is not valid.|  
|9|The specified trace handle is not valid.|  
|11|The specified column is used internally and cannot be removed.|  
|13|Out of memory. Returned when there is not enough memory to perform the specified action.|  
|16|The function is not valid for this trace.|  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_trace_setevent** performs many of the actions previously executed by extended stored procedures available in earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Use **sp_trace_setevent** instead of the following:  
  
-   **xp_trace_addnewqueue**  
  
-   **xp_trace_eventclassrequired**  
  
-   **xp_trace_seteventclassrequired**  
  
 Users must execute **sp_trace_setevent** for each column added for each event. During each execution, if **@on** is set to **1**, **sp_trace_setevent** adds the specified event to the list of events of the trace. If **@on** is set to **0**, **sp_trace_setevent** removes the specified event from the list.  
  
 Parameters of all SQL Trace stored procedures (**sp_trace_xx**) are strictly typed. If these parameters are not called with the correct input parameter data types, as specified in the argument description, the stored procedure will return an error.  
  
 For an example of using trace stored procedures, see [Create a Trace &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/sql-trace/create-a-trace-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Permissions  
 User must have ALTER TRACE permission.
