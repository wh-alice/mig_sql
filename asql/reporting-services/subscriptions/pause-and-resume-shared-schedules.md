# Pause and Resume Shared Schedules
  You can pause and resume a shared schedule that is in use. Pausing a shared schedule provides a way to temporarily freeze a schedule that is used to trigger report processing and subscriptions. Only shared schedules can be paused and resumed. You cannot pause report-specific schedules.  
  
 You cannot pause and resume report processing that is in progress. You can only pause and resume schedules that are in the scheduling queue of SQL Server Agent service. A job that is in progress is outside the scope of the scheduling engine. For more information, see [Manage a Running Process](../../reporting-services/subscriptions/manage-a-running-process.md)  
  
 While a shared schedule is paused, any operations that would have occurred are allowed to lapse. After you resume a shared schedule, report and subscription processing occurs at the next scheduled time, using the local time of the server. The native mode report server or SharePoint service applications, do not make up scheduled operations that would have occurred had the schedule not been paused.
