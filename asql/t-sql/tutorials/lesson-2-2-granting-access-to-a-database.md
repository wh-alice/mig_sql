# Lesson 2-2 - Granting Access to a Database
Mary now has access to this instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], but does not have permission to access the databases. She does not even have access to her default database **TestData** until you authorize her as a database user.  
  
To grant Mary access, switch to the **TestData** database, and then use the CREATE USER statement to map her login to a user named Mary.  
  
### To create a user in a database  
  
1.  Type and execute the following statements (replacing `computer_name` with the name of your computer) to grant `Mary` access to the `TestData` database.  
  
    ```  
    USE [TestData];  
    GO  
  
    CREATE USER [Mary] FOR LOGIN [computer_name\Mary];  
    GO  
  
    ```  
  
    Now, Mary has access to both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and the `TestData` database.
