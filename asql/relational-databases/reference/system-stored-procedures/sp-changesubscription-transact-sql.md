# sp_changesubscription (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Changes the properties of a snapshot or transactional push subscription or a pull subscription involved in queued updating transactional replication. To change properties of all other types of pull subscriptions, use [sp_change_subscription_properties &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-change-subscription-properties-transact-sql.md). **sp_changesubscription** is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When configuring a Publisher with a remote Distributor, the values supplied for all parameters, including *job_login* and *job_password*, are sent to the Distributor as plain text. You should encrypt the connection between the Publisher and its remote Distributor before executing this stored procedure. For more information, see [Enable Encrypted Connections to the Database Engine &#40;SQL Server Configuration Manager&#41;](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/enable-encrypted-connections-to-the-database-engine.md).
