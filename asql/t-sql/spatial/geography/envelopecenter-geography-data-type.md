# EnvelopeCenter (geography Data Type )
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns a point that can be used as the center of a bounding circle for the **geography** instance.  
  
 To determine the bounding circle, each point in the instance is described as a vector from the center of the Earth to the point on the Earth's surface. The center point of the bounding circle is calculated by averaging all of the vectors. For closed loops, either in a **polygon** instance or a **linestring** instance, the first and last point is used only once.  
  
 This **geography** data type method supports **FullGlobe** instances or spatial instances that are larger than a hemisphere.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
EnvelopeCenter( )  
```  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **geography**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlGeography**  
  
## Remarks  
 This method returns a **point**. When used with `EnvelopeAngle()`, `EnvelopeCenter()` returns a bounding circle of a **geography** instance.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  `EnvelopeCenter()` returns a bounding circle for a **geography** instance, but the results are not guaranteed to produce the minimal bounding circle. In contrast, the **geometry** data type method `STEnvelope()` is guaranteed to return the minimum bounding box when it is applied to a **geometry** instance.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] and higher, returns the center of the circle representing the envelope of this instance as a **point**. For all large objects as defined by `EnvelopeAngle()` = 180, `EnvelopeCenter()` will return (90,0).  
  
 This method is not precise.  
  
## Examples  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geography = 'LINESTRING(-120 45, -120 0, -90 0)';  
SELECT @g.EnvelopeCenter().ToString();  
```
