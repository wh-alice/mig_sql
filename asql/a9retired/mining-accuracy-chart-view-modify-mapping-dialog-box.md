# Mining Accuracy Chart View - Modify Mapping Dialog Box
  Use the **Modify Mapping** dialog box to change how the input columns are joined to the columns in the mining model. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] will map the columns automatically based on the column name and data type, but you can use this dialog box to change the column mappings. If you make changes, you must ensure that the columns in the external data source have data types and content types that match the columns in the mining model that you are testing.  
  
## Options  
 **Mining Structure Column**  
 A list of the mining structure columns that are defined in the selected mining structure.  
  
 **Table Column**  
 A list of the input columns that are associated with each mining structure column. To change the input column, click a cell and select a new input column from the list of columns that the input table contains.
