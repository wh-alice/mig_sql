# About the SQL Server License Terms
  The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Software License Terms are copied to the local computer when [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed. When multiple instances of the same edition and language of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are installed on the same computer, a single copy of the license terms will apply to all instances of that edition and language. The files are written to: %ProgramFiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\130\License Terms\ or %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\130\License Terms\\.  
  
 When multiple instances of the same [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition and language are installed on the same computer, a single copy of the license terms will apply to all instances of that edition and language.

The License terms file name is in the format: SQLServer2016_License_Edition_\<TYPE>_\<LCID>.rtf. For example:  
  
-   SQLServer2016_License_DEV_1033.rtf for [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../a9notintoc/includes/sssql14-md.md)] Developer, English language edition.  
  
-   SQLServer2016_License_EXPR_1033.rtf for [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../a9notintoc/includes/sssql14-md.md)] Express, English language edition.  
  
 TYPE indicates the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition. The following file name segments are used to identify [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] editions:
