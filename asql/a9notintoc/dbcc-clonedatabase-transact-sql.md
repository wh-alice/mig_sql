Rick, we did a KB article for this one since we had to list known issues and couple of other limitations. Once this becomes a full-fledged feature we can do a BOL topic. See KB [3177838](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3177838).

This command is currently working in SQL Server 2014, SP2, but it not yet in SQL Server 2016.

I created this topic, so if anyone tried to create a duplicate, they would run into this topic and get this information.
