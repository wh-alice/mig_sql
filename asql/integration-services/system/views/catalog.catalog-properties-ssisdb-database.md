[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../integration-services/system/stored-procedures/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Displays the properties of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] catalog.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|property_name|**nvarchar(256)**|The name of the catalog property.|  
|property_value|**nvarchar(256)**|The value of the catalog property.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This view displays a row for each catalog property. The properties displayed by this view include the following:  
  
|Property Name|Description|  
|-------------------|-----------------|  
|**ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM**|The type of encryption algorithm that is used to encrypt sensitive data. The supported values include: `DES`, `TRIPLE_DES`, `TRIPLE_DES_3KEY`, `DESX`, `AES_128`, `AES_192`, and `AES_256`. Note: The catalog database must be in single-user mode in order to change this property.|  
|**MAX_PROJECT_VERSIONS**|The number of new project versions that will be retained for a single project. When version cleanup is enabled, older versions beyond this count will be deleted.|  
|**OPERATION_CLEANUP_ENABLED**|When the value is `TRUE`, operation details and operation messages older than **RETENTION_WINDOW** (days) are deleted from the catalog. When the value is `FALSE`, all operation details and operation messages are stored in the catalog. Note: a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] job performs the operation cleanup.|  
|**RETENTION_WINDOW**|The number of days that operation details and operation messages are stored in the catalog. When the value is `-1`, the retention window is infinite. Note: If no cleanup is desired, set **OPERATION_CLEANUP_ENABLED** to **FALSE**.|  
|**VALIDATION_TIMEOUT**|Validations will be stopped if they do not complete in the number of seconds specified by this property.|  
|**VERSION_CLEANUP_ENABLED**|When the value is `TRUE`, only the **MAX_PROJECT_VERSIONS** number of project versions are stored in the catalog and all other project versions are deleted. When the value is **FALSE**, all project versions are stored in the catalog. Note: a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] job performs the operation cleanup.|  
|**SERVER_LOGGING_LEVEL**|The default logging level for the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] server.|
