# Specify a Merge Subscription Type and Conflict Resolution Priority (SQL Server Management Studio)
  Specify a merge subscription type and conflict resolution priority on the **Subscription Type** page of the New Subscription Wizard. For more information about using this wizard, see [Create a Pull Subscription](../../relational-databases/replication/create-a-pull-subscription.md) and [Create a Push Subscription](../../relational-databases/replication/create-a-push-subscription.md).  
  
 Subscription type cannot be modified after a subscription is created, but priority can be modified for the server subscription type in the **Subscription Properties - \<Publisher>: \<PublicationDatabase>** dialog box. For more information about accessing this dialog box, see [View and Modify Push Subscription Properties](../../relational-databases/replication/view-and-modify-push-subscription-properties.md) and [View and Modify Pull Subscription Properties](../../relational-databases/replication/view-and-modify-pull-subscription-properties.md).  
  
### To specify a merge subscription type and conflict resolution priority  
  
1.  On the **Subscription Type** page of the New Subscription Wizard, select **Client** or **Server** for the **Subscription Type** option.  
  
2.  If you select a subscription type of **Server**, also enter a value (0.00 to 99.99) for the **Priority for Conflict Resolution** option.  
  
### To modify the conflict resolution priority  
  
1.  In the **Subscription Properties - \<Publisher>: \<PublicationDatabase>** at the Publisher, enter a value (0.00 to 99.99) for the **Priority** option.
