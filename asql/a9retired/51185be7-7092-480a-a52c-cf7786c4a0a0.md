# SQL Server Profiler - Source Table/Database Engine Tuning Advisor - Select Workload Table
  Microsoft SQL Server Profiler and Tuning Advisor use this dialog box to select tables.  
  
 In Profiler, use the **Source Table** dialog box to specify a source table for a trace table. This is a table from which a trace is loaded, and the contents of which are viewed or used for replaying the trace.  
  
 In Tuning Advisor, use the **Select Workload Table** dialog box to select a database table that contains profiler trace information to use as a tuning workload, or to preview the table contents before starting tuning analysis.  
  
## Options  
 **SQL Server**  
 Specifies the instance of SQL Server currently connected. This field is populated automatically and cannot be updated.  
  
 **Database**  
 Specify the database where the trace table is located.  
  
 **Owner**  
 Specifies the owner of the trace table. This field is populated automatically as **dbo**.  
  
 **Table**  
 Specify the name of the trace table from which the trace should be read.
