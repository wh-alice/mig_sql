# New or Edit Server Registration (General Tab) (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use this tab to specify options when registering an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 To access this page, in Registered Servers click **Analysis Services** on the Registered Servers toolbar, right-click any registered servers group, such as **Analysis Services**, point to **New**, and then click **Server Registration**.  
  
## Options  
 **Server type**  
 When a server is registered from Registered Servers, the **Server type** box is read-only, and it matches the type of server displayed in the Registered Servers pane. To register a different type of server, click the server you want on the **Registered Servers** toolbar before starting to register a new server.  
  
 **Server name**  
 Select the server instance to connect to. The server instance last connected to is displayed by default.  
  
 **Authentication**  
 Windows Authentication allows a user to connect using their [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows credentials, as a Windows user or as a member of a Windows group.  
  
 **User name**  
 This option is not available in this release.  
  
 **Password**  
 This option is not available in this release.  
  
 **Remember password**  
 This option is not available in this release.  
  
 **Registered server name**  
 The name you want to appear in Registered Servers. This name does not have to match the **Server name** box.  
  
 **Registered server description**  
 Enter an optional description of the server.  
  
 **Test**  
 Click to test the connection to the server selected in **Server name**.  
  
 **Save**  
 Click to save the registered server settings.
