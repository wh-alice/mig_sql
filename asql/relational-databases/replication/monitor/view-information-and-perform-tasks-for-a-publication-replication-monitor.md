# View Information and Perform Tasks for a Publication (Replication Monitor)
  Replication Monitor provides the following tabs that include information about the selected publication:  
  
-   **All Subscriptions**  
  
     This tab displays information about all subscriptions to the selected publication.  
  
-   **Agents**  
  
     This tab displays information about all agents used by a publication:  
  
    -   The Snapshot Agent, which is used by all publications.  
  
    -   The Log Reader Agent, which is used by all transactional publications.  
  
    -   The Queue Reader Agent, which is used by transactional publications that have queued updating subscriptions.  
  
-   **Warnings** (for Distributors running [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] and later)  
  
    -   This tab allows you to specify warnings and alerts for agents.  
  
-   **Tracer Tokens** (transactional replication only, for Distributors running [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] and later)  
  
     This tab allows you to measure latency, the amount of time that elapses between a transaction being committed at the Publisher and the corresponding transaction being committed at the Subscriber.  
  
 For more information about the options on each tab, click the tab in the right pane, and then click **Help** on the menu bar. For information about starting Replication Monitor, see [Start the Replication Monitor](../../../relational-databases/replication/monitor/start-the-replication-monitor.md).  
  
### To view information and perform tasks for a publication  
  
1.  Expand a Publisher group in the left pane, expand a Publisher, and then click a publication.  
  
2.  To view and modify publication properties, right-click the publication, and then click **Properties**.

     To view and modify subscription properties, right-click the subscription, and then click **Properties**. You can also access more detailed information and perform tasks on this tab. For more information, see [View Information and Perform Tasks for the Agents Associated With a Subscription &#40;Replication Monitor&#41;](../../../relational-databases/replication/monitor/fbb59d31-2424-4552-9195-0da8d83e755f.md).
