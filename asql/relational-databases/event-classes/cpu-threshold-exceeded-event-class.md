# CPU Threshold Exceeded Event Class
  The CPU Threshold Exceeded event class indicates that Resource Governor detects a query that exceeds the CPU threshold specified for REQUEST_MAX_CPU_TIME_SEC.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The detection interval for this event is five seconds. It is guaranteed that an event will be generated if a query exceeds the specified limit by at least five seconds. However, if a query exceeds the specified threshold by less than five seconds, its detection might be missed depending on the timing of the query and the time of last detection sweep.
