# Generate and Publish Scripts Wizard
  You can use the **Generate and Publish Scripts Wizard** to create scripts for transferring a database between instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssSDSFull](../../a9retired/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)]. You can generate scripts for a database on an instance of the Database Engine in your local network, or from [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../a9retired/includes/sssds-md.md)]. The generated scripts can be run on another instance of the Database Engine or [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../a9retired/includes/sssds-md.md)]. You can also use the wizard to publish the contents of a database directly to a Web service created by using the Database Publishing Services. You can create scripts for an entire database, or limit it to specific objects.  
  
1.  **Before you begin:**  [Publishing to a Hosted Service](#PubHostSvc), [Permissions](#Permissions)  
  
2.  **To generate or publish a script, using:**  [The Generate and Publish Scripts Wizard](#GenPubScriptWiz)  
  
## Before You Begin  
 The source and target database can be on [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../a9retired/includes/sssds-md.md)], or an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] running [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] or later.  
  
###  <a name="PubHostSvc"></a> Publishing to a Hosted Service  
 In addition to creating scripts, the **Generate and Publish Scripts Wizard** can be used to publish a database to a specific type of hosted SQL Server Web service. The SQL Server Hosting Toolkit provides Database Publishing Services as a shared source project on CodePlex. The Database Publishing Services project can be used by Web hosting providers to build a set of Web services that make it easy for their customers to deploy databases to the Web service. For more information about downloading the SQL Server Hosting Toolkit, see [SQL Server Database Publishing Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=142025).  
  
 To publish a database to a Web hosting service, select the **Publish to Web Service** option on the **Set Scripting Options** page of the wizard.  
  
###  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 The minimum permission to publish a database is membership in the db_ddladmin fixed database role on the origin database. The minimum permission to publish a database script to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] at the hosting provider is membership in the db_ddladmin fixed database role on the target database.  
  
 The user also has to supply a user name and password to access their hosting provider account to publish with the wizard. The target database must be created at the hosting provider before the source database is published. Publishing overwrites objects in that existing database.  
  
##  <a name="GenPubScriptWiz"></a> Using the Generate and Publish Scripts Wizard  
 **To generate a publish a script**  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, expand the node for the instance containing the database to be scripted.  
  
2.  Point to **Tasks**, and then click **Generate Scripts**.  
  
3.  Complete the wizard dialogs:  
  
    -   [Introduction Page](#Introduction)  
  
    -   [Choose Objects Page](#ChooseObjects)  
  
    -   [Set Scripting Options Page](#SetScriptOpt)  
  
    -   [Advanced Scripting Options Page](#AdvScriptOpt)  
  
    -   [Manage Providers Page](#MgProviders)  
  
    -   [Advanced Publishing Options Page](#AdvPubOpts)  
  
    -   [Provider Configuration Page](#ProvConfig)  
  
    -   [Summary Page](#Summary)  
  
    -   [Save or Publish Scripts Page](#SavePubScripts)  
  
###  <a name="Introduction"></a> Introduction Page  
 This page describes the steps for generating or publishing a script.  
  
 **Do not show this page again** - Skip this page the next time you start the **Generate and Publish Scripts Wizard**.  
  
 **Next >** - Proceeds to the **Choose Method** page.  
  
 **Cancel** - Ends the wizard without generating or publishing a script from the database.  
  
###  <a name="ChooseObjects"></a> Choose Objects Page  
 Use this page to choose which objects you want to include in the scripts generated by this wizard. In the following wizard page, you will have the option to save these scripts to the location of your choice or use them to publish database objects to a remote Web hosting provider that has installed the [SQL Server Database Publishing Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=142025).  
  
 **Script Entire Database Option** - Click to generate scripts for all objects in the database and to include a script for the database itself.  
  
 **Select specific database objects** - Click to limit the wizard to generate scripts for only the specific objects in the database that you choose:  
  
-   **Database objects** - Select at least one object to include in the script.  
  
-   **Select All** - Selects all available check boxes.  
  
-   **Deselect All** - Clears all the check boxes. You must then select at least one database object to continue.  
  
###  <a name="SetScriptOpt"></a> Set Scripting Options Page  
 Use this page to specify if you want the wizard to save scripts to the location of your choice or to use them to publish database objects to a remote Web hosting provider. To publish, you must have access to a Web service installed by using the Database Publishing Services Web service.  
  
 **Options** - If you want the wizard to save scripts to a location of your choice, select **Save scripts to a specific location**. You can later run the scripts against either an instance of the Database Engine, or against [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../a9retired/includes/sssds-md.md)]. If you want the wizard to publish your database objects to a remote Web hosting provider, select **Publish to Web service**.  
  
 **Save Scripts to a Specific Location** – save one or more .Transact-SQL script files to a location you specify.  
  
-   **Advanced** - Display the **Advanced Scripting Options** dialog box where you can select advanced options for generating scripts.  
  
-   **Save to file** - Save the script to one or more .sql files. Click the browse button (**…**) to specify a name and location for the file. Select the **Overwrite existing file** check box to replace the file if one already exists with the same name. Click **Single file** or **Single file per object** to specify how the scripts should be generated. Click **Unicode text** or **ANSI text** to specify the kind of text that should be used in the script.  
  
-   **Save to Clipboard** - Save the Transact-SQL script to the Clipboard.  
  
-   **Save to new query window** - Generate the script to a Database Engine Query Editor window. If no editor window is open, a new editor window is opened as the target for the script.  
  
 **Publish to Web Service** - Publish the objects that you selected to a remote Web hosting service for which you have configured a provider.  
  
-   **Manage Providers** - Display the **Manage Providers** dialog box. Use the **Manage Providers** dialog box to add, edit, and delete hosting providers. Each provider specifies the connection information to a Web hosting service and the target databases on that service.  
  
-   **Advanced** - Display the **Advanced Publishing Options** dialog box where you can select advanced options for publishing scripts.  
  
-   **Provider** - Select the provider that specifies the connection information for the Web hosting service that hosts the database where you want to publish the objects that you selected. You must have at least one provider in the **Manage Providers** dialog box to select a provider.  
  
-   **Target database** - Select the target database where you want to publish the objects that you selected. You must select a provider before selecting a target database.  
  
###  <a name="AdvScriptOpt"></a> Advanced Scripting Options Page  
 Use this page to specify how you want this wizard to generate scripts. Many different options are available. Options are greyed out if they are not supported by the version of SQL Server or [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../a9retired/includes/sssds-md.md)] specified in **Database engine type**.

## Generating Scripts on Azure SQL Data Warehouse  

If the syntax generated when using “Script As…” does not look like [!INCLUDE[ssSDW_md](../../a9retired/includes/sssdw-md.md)] syntax or if you receive an error message, you may need to set your scripting options in SQL Server Management Studio to [!INCLUDE[ssSDW_md](../../a9retired/includes/sssdw-md.md)].  

### How to set default scripting options to SQL Data Warehouse  

In order to script objects with [!INCLUDE[ssSDW_md](../../a9retired/includes/sssdw-md.md)] syntax, set the default scripting option to [!INCLUDE[ssSDW_md](../../a9retired/includes/sssdw-md.md)] as follows:  

1. Click **Tools** then **Options**.  
2. Under **General Scripting Options** set:  
    1. Script for the database engine type: **Microsoft Azure SQL Database**.  
    2. Script for the database engine edition: **Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse Edition**.  
3. Click **OK**.

### How to Generate Scripts for SQL Data Warehouse when it is not the default scripting option
