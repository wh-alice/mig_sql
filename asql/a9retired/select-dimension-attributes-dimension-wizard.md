# Select Dimension Attributes (Dimension Wizard)
  Use the **Select Dimension Attributes** page to select and modify the attributes for the dimension to be created.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you cannot read the values for any column, maximize the wizard window and change the width of each column heading until you can read the values.  
  
 **To open the Dimension Wizard**  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Dimensions** folder for an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project, and then click **New Dimension**.  
  
## Options  
 (Column with check boxes)  
 Select to include an attribute in the dimension.  
  
 To include a specific attribute, select the check box for that attribute.  
  
 To include all attributes, select the check box in the column header.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The check box for the key attribute cannot be cleared.  
  
 **Attribute Name**  
 Lists the available attributes.  
  
 To change the name of an attribute, click the attribute name and type a new name for the attribute.  
  
 **Enable Browsing**  
 Select to make the attribute available to the end user for browsing and filtering. **Enable Browsing** must be selected for the key attribute. For non-key attributes, the default is not to have **Enable Browsing** selected, which causes the non-key attributes to be shown only as member properties.  
  
 In most cases, the attribute is made available or not available for browsing by setting the **AttributeHierarchyEnabled** property to **True** or **False**, respectively. However, in the following three cases, the wizard uses different settings.  
  
|Case|Settings|  
|----------|--------------|  
|A dimension contains a parent-child hierarchy and **Enable Browsing** is not selected|The wizard leaves the **AttributeHierarchyEnabled** property set to **True**, and sets the **AttributeHierarchyVisible** attribute to **False** for the key attribute.|  
|A table in a dimension contains a foreign key to a table that is not in the dimension|The wizard selects the foreign key as an attribute to be included, but will not select **Enable Browsing**. If you keep these settings, the **AttributeHiearchyEnabled** property of the attribute will be set to **True**, and the **AttributeHieararchyVisible** property will be set to **False**.|  
|A dimension contains snowflake tables that are reached through nullable foreign key columns<br /><br /> —and—<br /><br /> Enable Browsing for the attribute that is based on the key of the snowflake table is not selected|The wizard will create the new attribute that has the **AttributeHiearchyEnabled** property set to **True**, and the **AttributeHieararchyVisible** property set to **False**.|  
  
 **Attribute Type**  
 (Optional) Set the type for the attribute. The default value is **Regular**. The attribute type provides guidance to client applications on what information the attribute might contain.
