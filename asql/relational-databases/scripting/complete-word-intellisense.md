# Complete Word (IntelliSense)
  The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] IntelliSense Complete Word option types the rest of a variable, command, or function name once you have entered enough characters to uniquely identify the term.  
  
 There are four ways to invoke the Complete Word feature:  
  
-   On the **Edit** menu, point to **IntelliSense**, and then click **Complete Word**.  
  
-   Press ALT+RIGHT ARROW.  
  
-   Right-click the text editor, and click **Complete Word**.  
  
-   Click the **Complete Word** button on the **Text Editor** toolbar.  
  
 If what you have typed has more than one possible match, invoke Complete Word to display a list of possible matches, which you can then use to find the term and insert it into your code.
