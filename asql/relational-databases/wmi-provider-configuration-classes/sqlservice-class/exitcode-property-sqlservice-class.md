# ExitCode Property (SqlService Class)
  Gets or sets the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Win32 error code that defines problems encountered when starting and stopping the service.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
object.ExitCode [= value]  
```  
  
## Parts  
 *object*  
 A [SqlService Class](../../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-configuration-classes/sqlservice-class/sqlservice-class.md) object that represents the service.  
  
## Property Value/Return Value  
 A **uint32** value that specifies the exit code.  
  
## Remarks
