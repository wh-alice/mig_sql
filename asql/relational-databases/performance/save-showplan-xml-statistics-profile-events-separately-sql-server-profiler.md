# Save Showplan XML Statistics Profile Events Separately (SQL Server Profiler)
  This topic describes how to save **Showplan XML Statistics Profile** events that are captured in traces into separate .SQLPlan files by using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)]. You can open the **Showplan XML Statistics Profile** event files in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], which enables you to view the graphical execution plan for each event.  
  
### To save Showplan XML statistics events separately  
  
1.  On the **File** menu, click **New Trace**, and then connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
     The **Trace Properties** dialog box appears.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If **Start tracing immediately after making connection**is selected, the **Trace Properties**dialog box does not appear and the trace begins instead. To turn off this setting, on the **Tools**menu, click **Options**, and clear the **Start tracing immediately after making connection** check box.  
  
2.  In the **Trace Properties** dialog box, type a name for the trace in the **Trace name** box.  
  
3.  In the **Use the template** list, select a trace template to base the trace on, or select **Blank** if you do not want to use a template.  
  
4.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   Click**Save to file**to capture the trace to a file. Specify a value for **Set maximum file size**.  
  
         Optionally select **Enable file rollover** and **Server processes trace data**.  
  
    -   Click**Save to table** to capture the trace to a database table.  
  
         Optionally click **Set maximum rows**, and specify a value.  
  
5.  Optionally select the **Enable trace stop time** check box, and specify a stop date and time.  
  
6.  Click the **Events Selection**tab.  
  
7.  In the **Events**data column, expand the **Performance**event category, and then select the **Showplan XML Statistics Profile**check box. If the **Performance** event category is not available, check **Show all events** to display it.  
  
     The **Events Extraction Settings**tab is added to the **Trace Properties**dialog.  
  
8.  On the **Events Extraction Settings**tab, click **Save XML Showplan events separately**.  
  
9. In the **Save As** dialog box, enter the file name to store the **Showplan XML Statistics Profile** events.  
  
10. Click **All batches in a single file** to save all **Showplan XML Statistics Profile** events in a single XML file, or click **Each XML Showplan batch in a distinct file**to create a new XML file for each **Showplan XML Statistics Profile** event.  
  
11. To view the **Showplan XML Statistics Profile** event file in SQL Server Management Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and click **File**. Navigate to the directory where you saved the **Showplan XML Statistics Profile** event file or files to select one and open it. **Showplan XML Statistics Profile** event files have a .SQLPlan file extension.
