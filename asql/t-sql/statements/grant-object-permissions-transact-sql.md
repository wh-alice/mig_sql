# GRANT Object Permissions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Grants permissions on a table, view, table-valued function, stored procedure, extended stored procedure, scalar function, aggregate function, service queue, or synonym.  
  
||

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
GRANT <permission> [ ,...n ] ON   
    [ OBJECT :: ][ schema_name ]. object_name [ ( column [ ,...n ] ) ]  
    TO <database_principal> [ ,...n ]   
    [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]  
    [ AS <database_principal> ]  
  
<permission> ::=  
    ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] | permission [ ( column [ ,...n ] ) ]  
  
<database_principal> ::=   
        Database_user   
    | Database_role   
    | Application_role   
    | Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_User   
    | Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_Group   
    | Database_user_mapped_to_certificate   
    | Database_user_mapped_to_asymmetric_key   
    | Database_user_with_no_login  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be granted on a schema-contained object. For a list of the permissions, see the Remarks section later in this topic.  
  
 ALL  
 Granting ALL does not grant all possible permissions. Granting ALL is equivalent to granting all [!INCLUDE[vcpransi](../../integration-services/data-flow/includes/vcpransi-md.md)]-92 permissions applicable to the specified object. The meaning of ALL varies as follows:  
  
 Scalar function permissions: EXECUTE, REFERENCES.  
  
 Table-valued function permissions: DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, UPDATE.  
  
 Stored procedure permissions: EXECUTE.  
  
 Table permissions: DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, UPDATE.  
  
 View permissions: DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, UPDATE.  
  
 PRIVILEGES  
 Included for [!INCLUDE[vcpransi](../../integration-services/data-flow/includes/vcpransi-md.md)]-92 compliance. Does not change the behavior of ALL.  
  
 *column*  
 Specifies the name of a column in a table, view, or table-valued function on which the permission is being granted. The parentheses ( ) are required. Only SELECT, REFERENCES, and UPDATE permissions can be granted on a column. *column* can be specified in the permissions clause or after the securable name.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  A table-level DENY does not take precedence over a column-level GRANT. This inconsistency in the permissions hierarchy has been preserved for backward compatibility.  
  
 ON [ OBJECT :: ] [ *schema_name* ] . *object_name*  
 Specifies the object on which the permission is being granted. The OBJECT phrase is optional if *schema_name* is specified. If the OBJECT phrase is used, the scope qualifier (::) is required. If *schema_name* is not specified, the default schema is used. If *schema_name* is specified, the schema scope qualifier (.) is required.  
  
 TO <database_principal>  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is being granted.  
  
 WITH GRANT OPTION  
 Indicates that the principal will also be given the ability to grant the specified permission to other principals.  
  
 AS <database_principal>  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to grant the permission.  
  
 *Database_user*  
 Specifies a database user.  
  
 *Database_role*  
 Specifies a database role.  
  
 *Application_role*  
 Specifies an application role.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_User*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a Windows user.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_Group*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a Windows group.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_certificate*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a certificate.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_asymmetric_key*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to an asymmetric key.  
  
 *Database_user_with_no_login*  
 Specifies a database user with no corresponding server-level principal.  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  A combination of ALTER and REFERENCE permissions in some cases could allow the grantee to view data or execute unauthorized functions. For example: A user with ALTER permission on a table and REFERENCE permission on a function can create a computed column over a function and have it be executed. In this case the user would also need SELECT permission on the computed column.  
  
 Information about objects is visible in various catalog views. For more information, see [Object Catalog Views &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/object-catalog-views-transact-sql.md).  
  
 An object is a schema-level securable contained by the schema that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be granted on an object are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Object permission|Implied by object permission|Implied by schema permission|  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|DELETE|CONTROL|DELETE|  
|EXECUTE|CONTROL|EXECUTE|  
|INSERT|CONTROL|INSERT|  
|RECEIVE|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|SELECT|RECEIVE|SELECT|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|UPDATE|CONTROL|UPDATE|  
|VIEW CHANGE TRACKING|CONTROL|VIEW CHANGE TRACKING|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 The grantor (or the principal specified with the AS option) must have either the permission itself with GRANT OPTION, or a higher permission that implies the permission being granted.  
  
 If you are using the AS option, the following additional requirements apply.  
  
|AS|Additional permission required|  
|--------|------------------------------------|  
|Database user|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the db_securityadmin fixed database role, membership in the db_owner fixed database role, or membership in the sysadmin fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a Windows login|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the db_securityadmin fixed database role, membership in the db_owner fixed database role, or membership in the sysadmin fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a Windows Group|Membership in the Windows group, membership in the db_securityadmin fixed database role, membership in the db_owner fixed database role, or membership in the sysadmin fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a certificate|Membership in the db_securityadmin fixed database role, membership in the db_owner fixed database role, or membership in the sysadmin fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to an asymmetric key|Membership in the db_securityadmin fixed database role, membership in the db_owner fixed database role, or membership in the sysadmin fixed server role.|  
|Database user not mapped to any server principal|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the db_securityadmin fixed database role, membership in the db_owner fixed database role, or membership in the sysadmin fixed server role.|  
|Database role|ALTER permission on the role, membership in the db_securityadmin fixed database role, membership in the db_owner fixed database role, or membership in the sysadmin fixed server role.|  
|Application role|ALTER permission on the role, membership in the db_securityadmin fixed database role, membership in the db_owner fixed database role, or membership in the sysadmin fixed server role.|  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Granting SELECT permission on a table  
 The following example grants `SELECT` permission to user `RosaQdM` on table `Person.Address` in the `AdventureWorks2012` database.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GRANT SELECT ON OBJECT::Person.Address TO RosaQdM;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Granting EXECUTE permission on a stored procedure  
 The following example grants `EXECUTE` permission on stored procedure `HumanResources.uspUpdateEmployeeHireInfo` to an application role called `Recruiting11`.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;   
GRANT EXECUTE ON OBJECT::HumanResources.uspUpdateEmployeeHireInfo  
    TO Recruiting11;  
GO   
```  
  
### C. Granting REFERENCES permission on a view with GRANT OPTION  
 The following example grants `REFERENCES` permission on column `BusinessEntityID` in view `HumanResources.vEmployee` to user `Wanida` with `GRANT OPTION`.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GRANT REFERENCES (BusinessEntityID) ON OBJECT::HumanResources.vEmployee   
    TO Wanida WITH GRANT OPTION;  
GO  
```  
  
### D. Granting SELECT permission on a table without using the OBJECT phrase  
 The following example grants `SELECT` permission to user `RosaQdM` on table `Person.Address` in the `AdventureWorks2012` database.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GRANT SELECT ON Person.Address TO RosaQdM;  
GO  
```  
  
### E. Granting SELECT permission on a table to a domain account  
 The following example grants `SELECT` permission to user `AdventureWorks2012\RosaQdM` on table `Person.Address` in the `AdventureWorks2012` database.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GRANT SELECT ON Person.Address TO [AdventureWorks2012\RosaQdM];  
GO  
```  
  
### F. Granting EXECUTE permission on a procedure to a role  
 The following example creates a role and then grants `EXECUTE` permission to the role on procedure `uspGetBillOfMaterials` in the `AdventureWorks2012` database.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
CREATE ROLE newrole ;  
GRANT EXECUTE ON dbo.uspGetBillOfMaterials TO newrole ;  
GO  
```
