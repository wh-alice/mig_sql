# SQL Server Profiler - Replay Configuration (Basic Replay Options)
  In the **Replay Configuration** dialog box, use the **Basic Replay Options** page to specify how to replay a trace file or table.  
  
 To view this window, use [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] to open a trace file or table that contains the appropriate events for replay. For more information, see [Replay Requirements](../tools/sql-server-profiler/replay-requirements.md). While the trace file or table is open, on the **Replay** menu, click **Start**, and then connect to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] where you want to replay the trace.  
  
## Options  
 **Replay server**  
 Displays the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to connect to for the replay.  
  
 **Change...**  
 Launches the **Connect to Server** dialog box to connect to another server.  
  
 **Save to file**  
 Save the replay results to a file. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the standard file dialog, where you can specify the location to save the file.  
  
 **Save to table**  
 Save the replay results to a table. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the table selection dialog, where you can specify the location to save the table.  
  
 **Number of replay threads**  
 Specify the number of replay threads to use concurrently. A higher number consumes more resources during replay, but replay is faster and more concurrent.  
  
 **Replay events in the order they were traced**  
 Replay events sequentially. Use this option if you are replaying a trace for debugging.  
  
 **Replay events using multiple threads**  
 Replay events concurrently. This option is faster than replaying events sequentially, but disables debugging. The events are ordered within their system process identifiers (SPID).  
  
 **Display replay results**  
 Display replay results in [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)].
