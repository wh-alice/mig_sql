# Active Geo-Replication - sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This procedure is scoped to an [!INCLUDE[ssGeoDR](../../../a9retired/includes/ssgeodr-md.md)] relationship between a primary and secondary. Calling the **sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync** causes the application to wait until all committed transactions are replicated and acknowledged by the active secondary database. Run **sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync** on only the primary database.  
  
||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../../a9retired/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].|  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync [ @target_server = ] 'server_name'   
     , [ @target_database = ] 'database_name'  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ @target_server = ] 'server_name'  
 The name of the SQL Database server that hosts the active secondary database. server_name is sysname, with no default.  
  
 [ @target_database = ] 'database_name'  
 The name of the active secondary database. database_name is sysname, with no default.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 Returns 0 for success or an error number for failure.  
  
 The most likely error conditions are as follows:  
  
-   The server name or database name is missing.  
  
-   The link cannot be found to the specified server name or database.  
  
-   Interlink connectivity is lost. **sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync** will return after the connection timeout.  
  
## Permissions  
 Any user in the primary database can call this system stored procedure. The login must be a user in both the primary and active secondary databases.  
  
## Remarks  
 All transactions committed before a **sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync** call are sent to the active secondary database.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example invokes **sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync** to ensure that all transactions are committed to the primary database, db0, get sent to its active secondary database on the target server ubfyu5ssyt.  
  
```  
USE db0;  
GO  
EXEC sys.sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync @target_server = N'ubfyu5ssyt1', @target_database = N'db0';  
GO  
```
