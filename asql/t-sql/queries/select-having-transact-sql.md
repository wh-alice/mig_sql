# SELECT - HAVING (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Specifies a search condition for a group or an aggregate. HAVING can be used only with the SELECT statement. HAVING is typically used in a GROUP BY clause. When GROUP BY is not used, HAVING behaves like a WHERE clause.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../a9notintoc/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
-- Syntax for SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
[ HAVING <search condition> ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 <search_condition>  
 Specifies the search condition for the group or the aggregate to meet.  
  
 The **text**, **image**, and **ntext** data types cannot be used in a HAVING clause.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example that uses a simple `HAVING` clause retrieves the total for each `SalesOrderID` from the `SalesOrderDetail` table that exceeds `$100000.00`.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012 ;  
GO  
SELECT SalesOrderID, SUM(LineTotal) AS SubTotal  
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail  
GROUP BY SalesOrderID  
HAVING SUM(LineTotal) > 100000.00  
ORDER BY SalesOrderID ;  
```  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../a9notintoc/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../a9notintoc/includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
 The following example uses a `HAVING` clause to retrieve the total for each `SalesAmount` from the `FactInternetSales` table when the `OrderDateKey` is in the year 2004 or later.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT OrderDateKey, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales   
FROM FactInternetSales  
GROUP BY OrderDateKey   
HAVING SUM(SalesAmount) > 80000  
ORDER BY OrderDateKey;  
```
