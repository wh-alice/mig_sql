## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To change the order of an attribute

2.  On the **Manage Model** page, select a model from the grid and then click **Entities**.  
  
3.  On the **Manage Entity** page, select the row for the entity that you want to create an attribute for.  
  
4.  Click **Attributes**.  
  
5.  On the **Manage Attributes** page, do one of the following.  
  
    -   If the attribute is for leaf members, select **Leaf** from the **Member Types** list box.  
  
    -   If the attribute is for consolidated members, select **Consolidated** from the **Member Types** list box.  
  
    -   If the attribute is for collections, select **Collection** from the **Member Types** list box.  
  
6.  Select the row for the attribute you want to change the order of.
