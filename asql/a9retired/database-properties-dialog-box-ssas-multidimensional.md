# Database Properties Dialog Box (SSAS - Multidimensional)
  Use the **Database Properties** dialog box in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to set the properties of a database in an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database. You can display the **Database Properties** dialog box by right-clicking a database in Object Explorer and selecting **Properties**.

Valid values include the following:<br /><br /> **ImpersonateAccount** (use a specific Windows user name and password).<br /><br /> **ImpersonateService** (use the service account).<br /><br /> **ImpersonateCurrentUser** (use the credentials of the current user).<br /><br /> **Default** (use the service account for MOLAP operations and current user for data mining).<br /><br /> Although you can set data source impersonation settings at the database level, doing so will only affect those data sources that specify **Inherit** for their impersonation settings. Impersonation settings specified directly on the data source will always override any settings that are specified at the database level.<br /><br /> When choosing an impersonation option, consider the types of operations that will need to be supported. Some operations, such as processing, cannot be performed by|
