# Lead (MDX)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns the member that is a specified number of positions following a specified member along the member's level.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Member_Expression.Lead( Index )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Member_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a member.  
  
 *Index*  
 A valid numeric expression that specifies a number of member positions.  
  
## Remarks  
 Member positions within a level are determined by the attribute hierarchy's natural order. The numbering of the positions is zero-based.  
  
 If the specified lead is zero (0), the **Lead** function returns the specified member.  
  
 If the specified lead is negative, the **Lead** function returns a prior member.  
  
 `Lead(1)` is equivalent to the [NextMember](../mdx/nextmember-mdx.md) function. `Lead(-1)` is equivalent to the [PrevMember](../mdx/prevmember-mdx.md) function.  
  
 The **Lead** function is similar to the [Lag](../mdx/lag-mdx.md) function, except that the **Lag** function looks in the opposite direction to the **Lead** function. That is, `Lead(n)` is equivalent to `Lag(-n)`.  
  
## Example  
 The following example returns the value for December 2001:  
  
```  
SELECT [Date].[Fiscal].[Month].[February 2002].Lead(-2) ON 0  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
  
```  
  
 The following example returns the value for March 2002:  
  
```  
SELECT [Date].[Fiscal].[Month].[February 2002].Lead(1) ON 0  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
  
```
