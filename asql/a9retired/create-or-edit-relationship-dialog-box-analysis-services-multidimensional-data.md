# Create or Edit Relationship Dialog Box (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the **Create/Edit Relationship** dialog box in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to define or modify a relationship in a data source view. You can display the **Create/Edit Relationship** dialog box by:  
  
-   Clicking **New Relationship** in the **Toolbar** pane of **Data Source View Designer**.  
  
-   Right-clicking a table in either the **Tables** or **Diagram** pane of **Data Source View Designer** and selecting **New Relationship**.
