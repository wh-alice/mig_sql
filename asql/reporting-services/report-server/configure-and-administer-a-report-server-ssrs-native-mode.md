# Configure and Administer a Report Server (SSRS Native Mode)
  This topic summarizes the approaches that you can use to configure [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. It also includes a list of topics that explain how to configure specific components, features, or server capabilities. To configure [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], you can:  
  
-   Use the Reporting Services Configuration Manager. Many of the topics in this section contain information about how to configure specific features through this tool.  
  
-   Use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] to customize server properties, enable My Reports, enable trace logs, and set site-wide defaults. For more information about site settings, see [Reporting Services Report Server &#40;Native Mode&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-server/reporting-services-report-server-native-mode.md) for Management Studio. Note that you can create and run script that sets server properties programmatically. For more information, see [Script Deployment and Administrative Tasks](../../reporting-services/tools/script-deployment-and-administrative-tasks.md) and [Report Server System Properties](../../reporting-services/report-server-web-service/net-framework/reporting-services-properties-report-server-system-properties.md).  
  
-   Use Report Manager to grant permissions to access the report server. Permissions are conveyed through role assignments that you define for each user or group account. For more information, see [Roles and Permissions &#40;Reporting Services&#41;](../../reporting-services/security/roles-and-permissions-reporting-services.md).  
  
-   Optionally, modify configuration files to change application settings. For more information about each file and guidelines for modifying them, see [Reporting Services Configuration Files](../../reporting-services/report-server/reporting-services-configuration-files.md).
