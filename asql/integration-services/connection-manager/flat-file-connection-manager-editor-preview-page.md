 To learn more about the Flat File connection manager, see [Flat File Connection Manager](../../integration-services/connection-manager/flat-file-connection-manager.md).  
  
## Options

 Provide a unique name for the Flat File connection in the workflow. The name provided will be displayed within [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer.  
  
 **Description**  
 Describe the connection. As a best practice, describe the connection in terms of its purpose, to make packages self-documenting and easier to maintain.

 Specify how many rows to skip at the beginning of the flat file.  
  
 **Refresh**  
 View the effect of changing the number of rows to skip by clicking **Refresh**. This button only becomes visible after you have changed other connection options.
