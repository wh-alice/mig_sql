# Partition Wizard F1 Help (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  You can use the Partition Wizard to define partitions for a measure group in a cube. By default, a single partition is defined for each measure group in a cube. Access and processing performance, however, can degrade for large partitions. By creating multiple partitions, each containing a portion of the data for a measure group, you can improve the access and processing performance for that measure group.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  It is possible to create partitions that may contain incorrect data by including duplicate rows in the **Specify Source Information** or **Restrict Rows** pages.  
  
 The Partition Wizard guides you through the following steps:  
  
-   Selecting the data source view for the partition.  
  
-   Creating a filter for the records included in the partition.  
  
-   Setting the processing and storage locations.  
  
-   Naming and saving the partition.
