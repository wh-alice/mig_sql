# Degree of Parallelism (7.0 Insert) Event Class
  The **Degree of Parallelism (7.0 Insert)** event class occurs each time [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] executes a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.  
  
 When this event class is included in a trace, the amount of entailed overhead may significantly impede performance if these events occur frequently. To minimize overhead incurred, limit use of this event class to traces that briefly monitor specific problems.  
  
## Degree of Parallelism (7.0 Insert) Event Class Data Columns  
  
|Data column name|Data type|Description|Column ID|Filterable|  
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|  
|**ApplicationName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the client application that created the connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This column is populated with the values passed by the application rather than the displayed name of the program.|10|Yes|  
|**BinaryData**|**image**|Number of CPUs used to complete the process based on the following values:<br /><br /> 0x00000000, indicates a serial plan running in serial.<br /><br /> 0x01000000, indicates a parallel plan running in serial.<br /><br /> >= 0x02000000 indicates a parallel plan running in parallel.|2|No|  
|**ClientProcessID**|**int**|ID assigned by the host computer to the process where the client application is running. This data column is populated if the client process ID is provided by the client.|9|Yes|  
|**DatabaseID**|**int**|ID of the database specified by the USE database statement or the default database if no USE database statement has been issued for a given instance. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the **ServerName** data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|  
|**DatabaseName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the database in which the user statement is running.|35|Yes|  
|**Event Class**|**int**|Type of Event = 28.|27|No|  
|**EventSequence**|**int**|Sequence of a given event within the request.|51|No|  
|**EventSubClass**|**int**|Indicates the statement executed, based on the following values:<br /><br /> 1=Select<br /><br /> 2=Insert<br /><br /> 3=Update<br /><br /> 4=Delete|21|No|  
|**GroupID**|**int**|ID of the workload group where the SQL Trace event fires.|66|Yes|  
|**HostName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the computer on which the client is running. This data column is populated if the host name is provided by the client. To determine the host name, use the HOST_NAME function.|8|Yes|  
|**Integer Data**|**int**|The amount of "workspace memory" in kilobytes that the query has been granted to perform operations involving hashing, sorts or create index operations. The memory will be acquired during execution as needed.|25|Yes|  
|**IsSystem**|**int**|Indicates whether the event occurred on a system process or a user process. 1 = system, 0 = user.|60|Yes|  
|**LoginName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the login of the user (either the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security login or the Windows login credentials in the form of DOMAIN\\*username*).|11|Yes|  
|**LoginSid**|**image**|Security identification number (SID) of the logged-in user. You can find this information in the sys.server_principals catalog view. Each SID is unique for each login in the server.|41|Yes|  
|**NTDomainName**|**nvarchar**|Windows domain to which the user belongs.|7|Yes|  
|**NTUserName**|**nvarchar**|Windows user name.|6|Yes|  
|**RequestID**|**int**|Request identification that initiated the full-text query.|49|Yes|  
|**ServerName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] being traced.|26|No|  
|**SessionLoginName**|**nvarchar**|Login name of the user who originated the session. For example, if you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using Login1 and execute a statement as Login2, **SessionLoginName** shows Login1 and **LoginName** shows Login2. This column displays both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows logins.|64|Yes|  
|**SPID**|**int**|ID of the session on which the event occurred.|12|Yes|  
|**StartTime**|**datetime**|Time at which the event started, if available.|14|Yes|  
|**TransactionID**|**bigint**|System-assigned ID of the transaction.|4|Yes|
