# Agent Profiles
  Use the **Agent Profiles** dialog box to manage agent profiles. Agent profiles provide a convenient way to manage the runtime parameters for each agent. Each agent has a default profile, and some agents have additional predefined profiles. For example, the Merge Agent has a "slow link" profile designed for low bandwidth connections. Predefined profiles are sufficient for most applications, but you can also create user-defined profiles, allowing you to customize agent behavior.  
  
## Options  
 **Select a page**  
 Select an agent in the left pane, and the profiles for the agent are displayed in the right pane.  
  
 **Default for New**  
 Select the profile that will be used when jobs are created for an agent of a given type. For example, if you create a number of subscriptions to a merge publication, the Merge Agent job for each subscription will use the profile selected. If you want to change the profile for existing jobs, select a profile, and then click **Change Existing Agents**.  
  
 **Name**  
 The name of the profile.  
  
 **Type**  
 The type of profile: **User** (user-defined) or **System** (predefined).  
  
 **Properties (...)**  
 Click to view the values used for each parameter in the agent profile.  
  
 **New**  
 Click to create a new profile.  
  
 **Delete**  
 Select a user-defined profile, and then click **Delete** to delete that profile. Predefined profiles cannot be deleted.  
  
 **Change Existing Agents**  
 Select a profile, and then click **Change Existing Agents** to specify that all existing jobs for an agent of a given type should use the selected profile. For example, if you have created a number of subscriptions to a merge publication, and you want to change the profile to specify that the Merge Agent job for each of these subscriptions should use the **Slow link agent profile**, select that profile, and then click **Change Existing Agents**.
