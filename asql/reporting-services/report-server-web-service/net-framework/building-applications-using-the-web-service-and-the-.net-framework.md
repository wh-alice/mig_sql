# Building Applications Using the Web Service and the .NET Framework
  With the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../a9retired/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], you can use familiar programming constructs, such as methods, primitive types, and user-defined complex types to work with Web services. The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../a9retired/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] contains an infrastructure and tools you can use to create Web service clients that can call any World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards-compliant Web service.  
  
 A Report Server Web service client is any component or application that communicates with a report server using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages.  
  
 **To create a Report Server Web service client using the .NET Framework, follow these basic steps:**  
  
1.  Create a proxy class for the Web service.  
  
     To do this, add a proxy class or Web reference to your development project, reference the proxy class in your client code, and create an instance of that proxy. For more information, see [Creating the Web Service Proxy](../../../reporting-services/report-server-web-service/net-framework/creating-the-web-service-proxy.md).  
  
2.  Authenticate the Web service client with the report server.  
  
     To do this, set the service object's <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.WebClientProtocol.Credentials%2A> property equal to the credentials of an authenticated user on the report server. For more information, see [Web Service Authentication](../../../reporting-services/report-server-web-service/net-framework/web-service-authentication.md).  
  
3.  Call the method of the proxy class corresponding to the Web service operation that you want to invoke.  
  
     To do this, call a Web service method and supply the necessary arguments. For more information about the Web service methods, see [Report Server Web Service Methods](../../../reporting-services/report-server-web-service/methods/report-server-web-service-methods.md). For more information about calling, see [Calling Web Service Methods](../../../reporting-services/report-server-web-service/net-framework/calling-web-service-methods.md).
