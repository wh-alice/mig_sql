# FILESTREAM (SQL Server)
  FILESTREAM enables [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]-based applications to store unstructured data, such as documents and images, on the file system. Applications can leverage the rich streaming APIs and performance of the file system and at the same time maintain transactional consistency between the unstructured data and corresponding structured data.  
  
 FILESTREAM integrates the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] with an NTFS or ReFS file systems by storing **varbinary(max)** binary large object (BLOB) data as files on the file system. [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements can insert, update, query, search, and back up FILESTREAM data. Win32 file system interfaces provide streaming access to the data.  
  
 FILESTREAM uses the NT system cache for caching file data. This helps reduce any effect that FILESTREAM data might have on [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] performance. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] buffer pool is not used; therefore, this memory is available for query processing.  
  
 FILESTREAM is not automatically enabled when you install or upgrade [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You must enable FILESTREAM by using SQL Server Configuration Manager and [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. To use FILESTREAM, you must create or modify a database to contain a special type of filegroup. Then, create or modify a table so that it contains a **varbinary(max)** column with the FILESTREAM attribute. After you complete these tasks, you can use [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] and Win32 to manage the FILESTREAM data.  
  

##  When to Use FILESTREAM  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], BLOBs can be standard **varbinary(max)** data that stores the data in tables, or FILESTREAM **varbinary(max)** objects that store the data in the file system. The size and use of the data determines whether you should use database storage or file system storage. If the following conditions are true, you should consider using FILESTREAM:  
  
-   Objects that are being stored are, on average, larger than 1 MB.  
  
-   Fast read access is important.  
  
-   You are developing applications that use a middle tier for application logic.  
  
 For smaller objects, storing **varbinary(max)** BLOBs in the database often provides better streaming performance.  
  

  
##  FILESTREAM Storage  
 FILESTREAM storage is implemented as a **varbinary(max)** column in which the data is stored as BLOBs in the file system. The sizes of the BLOBs are limited only by the volume size of the file system. The standard **varbinary(max)** limitation of 2-GB file sizes does not apply to BLOBs that are stored in the file system.  
  
 To specify that a column should store data on the file system, specify the FILESTREAM attribute on a **varbinary(max)** column. This causes the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] to store all data for that column on the file system, but not in the database file.  
  
 FILESTREAM data must be stored in FILESTREAM filegroups. A FILESTREAM filegroup is a special filegroup that contains file system directories instead of the files themselves. These file system directories are called *data containers*. Data containers are the interface between [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] storage and file system storage.  
  
 When you use FILESTREAM storage, consider the following:  
  
-   When a table contains a FILESTREAM column, each row must have a nonnull unique row ID.  
  
-   Multiple data containers can be added to a FILESTREAM filegroup.  
  
-   FILESTREAM data containers cannot be nested.  
  
-   When you are using failover clustering, the FILESTREAM filegroups must be on shared disk resources.  
  
-   FILESTREAM filegroups can be on compressed volumes.  
  
### Integrated Management  
 Because FILESTREAM is implemented as a **varbinary(max)** column and integrated directly into the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)], most [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] management tools and functions work without modification for FILESTREAM data. For example, you can use all backup and recovery models with FILESTREAM data, and the FILESTREAM data is backed up with the structured data in the database. If you do not want to back up FILESTREAM data with relational data, you can use a partial backup to exclude FILESTREAM filegroups.  
  
 
### Integrated Security  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], FILESTREAM data is secured just like other data is secured: by granting permissions at the table or column levels. If a user has permission to the FILESTREAM column in a table, the user can open the associated files.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Encryption is not supported on FILESTREAM data.  
  
 Only the account under which the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service account runs is granted permissions to the FILESTREAM container. We recommend that no other account be granted permissions on the data container.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  SQL logins will not work with FILESTREAM containers. Only NTFS or ReFS authentication will work with FILESTREAM containers.  
  
##  <a name="dual"></a> Accessing BLOB Data with Transact-SQL and File System Streaming Access  
 After you store data in a FILESTREAM column, you can access the files by using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] transactions or by using Win32 APIs.  
  
### Transact-SQL Access  
 By using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)], you can insert, update, and delete FILESTREAM data:  
  
-   You can use an insert operation to prepopulate a FILESTREAM field with a null value, empty value, or relatively short inline data. However, a large amount of data is more efficiently streamed into a file that uses Win32 interfaces.  
  
-   When you update a FILESTREAM field, you modify the underlying BLOB data in the file system. When a FILESTREAM field is set to NULL, the BLOB data associated with the field is deleted. You cannot use a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] chunked update, implemented as UPDATE**.**Write(), to perform partial updates to the data.  
  
-   When you delete a row or delete or truncate a table that contains FILESTREAM data, you delete the underlying BLOB data in the file system.  
  
### File System Streaming Access  
 The Win32 streaming support works in the context of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] transaction. Within a transaction, you can use FILESTREAM functions to obtain a logical UNC file system path of a file. You then use the OpenSqlFilestream API to obtain a file handle. This handle can then be used by Win32 file streaming interfaces, such as ReadFile() and WriteFile(), to access and update the file by way of the file system.  
  
 Because file operations are transactional, you cannot delete or rename FILESTREAM files through the file system.  
  
 **Statement Model**  
  
 The FILESTREAM file system access models a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement by using file open and close. The statement starts when a file handle is opened and ends when the handle is closed. For example, when a write handle is closed, any possible AFTER trigger that is registered on the table fires as if an UPDATE statement is completed.  
  
 **Storage Namespace**  
  
 In FILESTREAM, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] controls the BLOB physical file system namespace. A new intrinsic function, [PathName](../../relational-databases/reference/system-functions/pathname-transact-sql.md), provides the logical UNC path of the BLOB that corresponds to each FILESTREAM cell in the table. The application uses this logical path to obtain the Win32 handle and operate on the BLOB data by using regular Win32 file system interfaces. The function returns NULL if the value of the FILESTREAM column is NULL.  
  
 **Transacted File System Access**  
  
 A new intrinsic function, [GET_FILESTREAM_TRANSACTION_CONTEXT()](../../t-sql/functions/get-filestream-transaction-context-transact-sql.md), provides the token that represents the current transaction that the session is associated with. The transaction must have been started and not yet aborted or committed. By obtaining a token, the application binds the FILESTREAM file system streaming operations with a started transaction. The function returns NULL in case of no explicitly started transaction.  
  
 All file handles must be closed before the transaction commits or aborts. If a handle is left open beyond the transaction scope, additional reads against the handle will cause a failure; additional writes against the handle will succeed, but the actual data will not be written to disk. Similarly, if the database or instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] shuts down, all open handles are invalidated.  
  
 **Transactional Durability**  
  
 With FILESTREAM, upon transaction commit, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] ensures transaction durability for FILESTREAM BLOB data that is modified from the file system streaming access.  
  
 **Isolation Semantics**  
  
 The isolation semantics are governed by [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] transaction isolation levels. Read-committed isolation level is supported for [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] and file system access. Repeatable read operations, and also serializable and snapshot isolations, are supported. Dirty read is not supported.  
  
 The file system access open operations do not wait for any locks. Instead, the open operations fail immediately if they cannot access the data because of transaction isolation. The streaming API calls fail with ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION if the open operation cannot continue because of isolation violation.  
  
 To allow for partial updates to be made, the application can issue a device FS control (FSCTL_SQL_FILESTREAM_FETCH_OLD_CONTENT) to fetch the old content into the file that the opened handle references. This will trigger a server-side old content copy. For better application performance and to avoid running into potential time-outs when you are working with very large files, we recommend that you use asynchronous I/O.  
  
 If the FSCTL is issued after the handle has been written to, the last write operation will persist, and prior writes that were made to the handle are lost.  
  
 **File System APIs and Supported Isolation Levels**  
  
 When a file system API cannot open a file because of an isolation violation, an ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION exception is returned. This isolation violation occurs when two transactions try to access the same file. The outcome of the access operation depends on the mode the file was opened in and the version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that the transaction is running on. The following table outlines the possibly outcomes for two transactions that are accessing the same file.  
  
|Transaction 1|Transaction 2|Outcome on SQL Server 2008|Outcome on SQL Server 2008 R2 and later versions|  
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|  
|Open for read.|Open for read.|Both succeed.|Both succeed.|  
|Open for read.|Open for write.|Both succeed. Write operations under transaction 2 do not affect read operations performed in transaction 1.|Both succeed. Write operations under transaction 2 do not affect read operations performed in transaction 1.|  
|Open for write.|Open for read.|Open for transaction 2 fails with an ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION exception.|Both succeed.|  
|Open for write.|Open for write.|Open for transaction 2 fails with an ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION exception.|Open for transaction 2 fails with an ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION exception.|  
|Open for read.|Open for SELECT.|Both succeed.|Both succeed.|

|Open for write.|open for SELECT.|Transaction 2 blocks until transaction 1 commits or ends the transaction, or the transaction lock times out.|Both succeed.|

|Open for UPDATE or DELETE.|Open for write.|The open operation on transaction 2 fails with an ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION exception.|The open operation on transaction 2 fails with an ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION exception.|  
|Open for SELECT with repeatable read.|Open for read.|Both succeed.|Both succeed.|  
|Open for SELECT with repeatable read.|Open for write.|The open operation on transaction 2 fails with an ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION exception.|The open operation on transaction 2 fails with an ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION exception.|  
  
 **Write-Through from Remote Clients**  
  
 Remote file system access to FILESTREAM data is enabled over the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. If the client is remote, no write operations are cached by the client side. The write operations will always be sent to the server. The data can be cached on the server side. We recommend that applications that are running on remote clients consolidate small write operations to make fewer write operations using larger data size.  
  
 Creating memory mapped views (memory mapped I/O) by using a FILESTREAM handle is not supported. If memory mapping is used for FILESTREAM data, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] cannot guarantee consistency and durability of the data or the integrity of the database.
