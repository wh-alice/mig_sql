# Supported Data Sources (SSAS - Multidimensional)
  This topic describes the types of data sources that you can use in a multidimensional model.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_supported_ds"></a> Supported Data Sources  
 You can retrieve data from the data sources in the following table. When you install [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], setup does not install the providers that are listed for each data source. Some providers might already be installed with other applications on your computer; in other cases you will need to download and install the provider.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Third party providers, such as the Oracle OLE DB Provider, may also be used to connect to third party databases, with support provided by those third parties.

|Source|Versions|File type|Providers*|  
|Access databases|Microsoft Access  2010, 2013, 2016|.accdb or .mdb|Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB provider|  
|SQL Server relational databases*|Microsoft SQL Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2014, 2016, [!INCLUDE[ssSDSFull](../../a9retired/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)] , Microsoft Analytics Platform System (APS)<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Note: For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../a9retired/includes/sssds-md.md)] on [Azure.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=157856).<br /><br /> Note: Analytics Platform System (APS) was formerly known as SQL Server Parallel Datawarehouse (PDW). Originally, connecting to PDW from Analysis Services required a special data provider. This provider was replaced in SQL Server 2012. Starting in SQL Server 2012, the SQL Server native client is used for connections to PDW/APS. For more information about APS, see the web site [Microsoft Analytics Platform System](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/analytics-platform-system/resources.aspx).|(not applicable)|OLE DB Provider for SQL Server<br /><br /> SQL Server Native Client OLE DB Provider<br /><br /> SQL Server Native 11.0 Client OLE DB Provider<br /><br /> .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Client|

|Other relational databases|(not applicable)|(not applicable)|An OLE DB provider|  
  
 \* ODBC data sources are not supported for multidimensional solutions. Although Analysis Services itself will handle the connection, the designers in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)] used for building solutions cannot connect to an ODBC data source, even when using the MSDASQL driver. If your business requirements include an ODBC data source, consider building a Tabular solution instead.  
  
 ** Some features require a SQL Server relational database that runs on-premises. Specifically, writeback, and ROLAP storage require that the underlying data source is a SQL Server relational database.
