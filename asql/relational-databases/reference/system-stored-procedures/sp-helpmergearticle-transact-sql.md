# sp_helpmergearticle (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns information about an article. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database or at a republishing Subscriber on the subscription database.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_helpmergearticle [ [ @publication = ] 'publication' ]  
    [ , [ @article= ] 'article' ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@publication=**] **'***publication***'**  
 Is the name of the publication about which to retrieve information. *publication*is **sysname**, with a default of **%**, which returns information about all merge articles contained in all publications in the current database.  
  
 [ **@article=**] **'***article***'**  
 Is the name of the article for which to return information. *article*is **sysname**, with a default of **%**, which returns information about all merge articles in the given publication.
