# SSAS Import Data - Text File
  You can import data from Microsoft Excel files and text files by using the Table Import Wizard.  
  
 Complete the steps in the wizard to connect to an Excel file or a text file and import data. In some cases, data can be imported more easily from an Excel file than a text file. If you encounter issues importing a text file, copy the data into Excel and import the Excel file instead.  
  
### To import data from a text file  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], click the **Model** menu, and then click **Import from Data Source**.  
  
2.  On the **Connect to a Data Source** page, under **Text Files**, select **Excel File** or **Text File**, and then click **Next**.  
  
3.  Follow the steps in the Table Import Wizard. On subsequent pages, you will be able to select specific tables and apply filters by using the **Select Tables and Views** page.
