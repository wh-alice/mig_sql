# XML Elements - Objects
  The XML for Analysis (XMLA) protocol uses two methods, **Discover** and **Execute**, to offer a standard way for applications to access information on an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. Because these methods are invoked by using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) protocol, they accept input and deliver output in XML.  
  
## In This Section  
 The following topics describe the XMLA objects implemented by [!INCLUDE[ssAS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/ssas-md.md)].  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[DiscoverResponse Element &#40;XMLA&#41;](../Topic/DiscoverResponse%20Element%20\(XMLA\).md)|Contains the information returned by an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] in response to a [Discover](../Topic/Discover%20Method%20\(XMLA\).md) method call.|  
|[ExecuteResponse Element &#40;XMLA&#41;](../Topic/ExecuteResponse%20Element%20\(XMLA\).md)|Contains the information returned by an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] in response to an [Execute](../Topic/Execute%20Method%20\(XMLA\).md) method call.|
