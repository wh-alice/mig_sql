# Lesson 1: Evaluate Best Practices on an On-Demand Basis
By using the on-demand (or "ad hoc") method of policy evaluation, you can quickly evaluate best practices policies to determine whether an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] meets best practices guidelines and recommendations.  
  
In this lesson, you will perform an on-demand evaluation of the best practices policies for the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] on one or more instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
This lesson contains the following topics:  
  
-   [Perform an On-Demand Evaluation by Using Object Explorer](../a9retired/perform-an-on-demand-evaluation-by-using-object-explorer.md) (for a single instance)  
  
-   [Perform an On-Demand Evaluation by Using Registered Servers](../a9retired/perform-an-on-demand-evaluation-by-using-registered-servers.md) (for one or more instances)  
  
## Next Task in Lesson  
[Perform an On-Demand Evaluation by Using Object Explorer](../a9retired/perform-an-on-demand-evaluation-by-using-object-explorer.md)
