    )]   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *database_name*  
 Is the database name in which the specified table or view resides. If not specified, this is the current database.  
  
 *schema_name*  
 Is the name of the table or view schema. *schema_name* is optional if the default schema for the user performing the bulk-import operation is schema of the specified table or view. If *schema* is not specified and the default schema of the user performing the bulk-import operation is different from the specified table or view, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] returns an error message, and the bulk-import operation is canceled.  
  
 *table_name*  
 Is the name of the table or view to bulk import data into. Only views in which all columns refer to the same base table can be used. For more information about the restrictions for loading data into views, see [INSERT &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/insert-transact-sql.md).  
  
 **'** *data_file* **'**  
 Is the full path of the data file that contains data to import into the specified table or view. BULK INSERT can import data from a disk (including network, floppy disk, hard disk, and so on).   
 
 *data_file* must specify a valid path from the server on which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running. If *data_file* is a remote file, specify the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) name. A UNC name has the form \\\\*Systemname*\\*ShareName*\\*Path*\\*FileName*. For example, `\\SystemX\DiskZ\Sales\update.txt`.   
**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1.   
Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP1.1, the data_file can be in Azure blob storage.

**'** *data_source_name* **'**   
**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1.   
Is a named external data source pointing to the Azure Blob storage location of the file that will be imported. The external data source must be created using the `TYPE = BLOB_STORAGE` option added in [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1. For more information, see [CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-data-source-transact-sql.md).    
  
 BATCHSIZE **=***batch_size*  
 Specifies the number of rows in a batch. Each batch is copied to the server as one transaction. If this fails, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] commits or rolls back the transaction for every batch. By default, all data in the specified data file is one batch. For information about performance considerations, see "Remarks," later in this topic.  
  
 CHECK_CONSTRAINTS  
 Specifies that all constraints on the target table or view must be checked during the bulk-import operation. Without the CHECK_CONSTRAINTS option, any CHECK and FOREIGN KEY constraints are ignored, and after the operation, the constraint on the table is marked as not-trusted.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  UNIQUE, and PRIMARY KEY constraints are always enforced. When importing into a character column that is defined with a NOT NULL constraint, BULK INSERT inserts a blank string when there is no value in the text file.  
  
 At some point, you must examine the constraints on the whole table. If the table was non-empty before the bulk-import operation, the cost of revalidating the constraint may exceed the cost of applying CHECK constraints to the incremental data.  
  
 A situation in which you might want constraints disabled (the default behavior) is if the input data contains rows that violate constraints. With CHECK constraints disabled, you can import the data and then use [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements to remove the invalid data.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The MAXERRORS option does not apply to constraint checking.  
  
 CODEPAGE **=** { **'**ACP**'** | **'**OEM**'** | **'**RAW**'** | **'***code_page***'** }  
 Specifies the code page of the data in the data file. CODEPAGE is relevant only if the data contains **char**, **varchar**, or **text** columns with character values greater than **127** or less than **32**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] recommends that you specify a collation name for each column in a [format file](../../relational-databases/import-export/use-a-format-file-to-bulk-import-data-sql-server.md).  
  
|CODEPAGE value|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|ACP|Columns of **char**, **varchar**, or **text** data type are converted from the [!INCLUDE[vcpransi](../../integration-services/data-flow/includes/vcpransi-md.md)]/[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows code page (ISO 1252) to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] code page.|  
|OEM (default)|Columns of **char**, **varchar**, or **text** data type are converted from the system OEM code page to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] code page.|  
|RAW|No conversion from one code page to another occurs; this is the fastest option.|  
|*code_page*|Specific code page number, for example, 850.<br /><br /> **\*\* Important \*\*** Versions prior to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] do not support code page 65001 (UTF-8 encoding).|  
  
 DATAFILETYPE **=** { **'char'** | **'native'** | **'widechar'** | **'widenative'** }  
 Specifies that BULK INSERT performs the import operation using the specified data-file type value.  
  
|DATAFILETYPE value|All data represented in:|  
|------------------------|------------------------------|  
|**char** (default)|Character format.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Use Character Format to Import or Export Data &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/use-character-format-to-import-or-export-data-sql-server.md).|  
|**native**|Native (database) data types. Create the native data file by bulk importing data from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using the **bcp** utility.<br /><br /> The native value offers a higher performance alternative to the char value.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Use Native Format to Import or Export Data &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/use-native-format-to-import-or-export-data-sql-server.md).|  
|**widechar**|Unicode characters.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Use Unicode Character Format to Import or Export Data &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/use-unicode-character-format-to-import-or-export-data-sql-server.md).|  
|**widenative**|Native (database) data types, except in **char**, **varchar**, and **text** columns, in which data is stored as Unicode. Create the **widenative** data file by bulk importing data from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using the **bcp** utility.<br /><br /> The **widenative** value offers a higher performance alternative to **widechar**. If the data file contains [!INCLUDE[vcpransi](../../integration-services/data-flow/includes/vcpransi-md.md)] extended characters, specify **widenative**.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Use Unicode Native Format to Import or Export Data &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/use-unicode-native-format-to-import-or-export-data-sql-server.md).|  
  
  ERRORFILE **='***file_name***'**  
 Specifies the file used to collect rows that have formatting errors and cannot be converted to an OLE DB rowset. These rows are copied into this error file from the data file "as is."  
  
 The error file is created when the command is executed. An error occurs if the file already exists. Additionally, a control file that has the extension .ERROR.txt is created. This references each row in the error file and provides error diagnostics. As soon as the errors have been corrected, the data can be loaded.   
**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1.
Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)], the `error_file_path` can be in Azure blob storage.

'errorfile_data_source_name'   
**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1.
Is a named external data source pointing to the Azure Blob storage location of the error file that will contain errors found during the import. The external data source must be created using the `TYPE = BLOB_STORAGE` option added in [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1. For more information, see [CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-data-source-transact-sql.md).
 
 FIRSTROW **=***first_row*  
 Specifies the number of the first row to load. The default is the first row in the specified data file. FIRSTROW is 1-based.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The FIRSTROW attribute is not intended to skip column headers. Skipping headers is not supported by the BULK INSERT statement. When skipping rows, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] looks only at the field terminators, and does not validate the data in the fields of skipped rows.  
  
 FIRE_TRIGGERS  
 Specifies that any insert triggers defined on the destination table execute during the bulk-import operation. If triggers are defined for INSERT operations on the target table, they are fired for every completed batch.  
  
 If FIRE_TRIGGERS is not specified, no insert triggers execute.  

FORMATFILE_DATASOURCE **=** 'data_source_name'   
**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] 1.1.   
Is a named external data source pointing to the Azure Blob storage location of the format file that will define the schema of imported data. The external data source must be created using the `TYPE = BLOB_STORAGE` option added in [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1. For more information, see [CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-data-source-transact-sql.md).
  
 KEEPIDENTITY  
 Specifies that identity value or values in the imported data file are to be used for the identity column. If KEEPIDENTITY is not specified, the identity values for this column are verified but not imported and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] automatically assigns unique values based on the seed and increment values specified during table creation. If the data file does not contain values for the identity column in the table or view, use a format file to specify that the identity column in the table or view is to be skipped when importing data; [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] automatically assigns unique values for the column. For more information, see [DBCC CHECKIDENT &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkident-transact-sql.md).  
  
 For more information, see about keeping identify values see [Keep Identity Values When Bulk Importing Data &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/keep-identity-values-when-bulk-importing-data-sql-server.md).  
  
 KEEPNULLS  
 Specifies that empty columns should retain a null value during the bulk-import operation, instead of having any default values for the columns inserted. For more information, see [Keep Nulls or Use Default Values During Bulk Import &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/keep-nulls-or-use-default-values-during-bulk-import-sql-server.md).  
  
 KILOBYTES_PER_BATCH **=** *kilobytes_per_batch*  
 Specifies the approximate number of kilobytes (KB) of data per batch as *kilobytes_per_batch*. By default, KILOBYTES_PER_BATCH is unknown. For information about performance considerations, see "Remarks," later in this topic.  
  
 LASTROW**=***last_row*  
 Specifies the number of the last row to load. The default is 0, which indicates the last row in the specified data file.  
  
 MAXERRORS **=** *max_errors*  
 Specifies the maximum number of syntax errors allowed in the data before the bulk-import operation is canceled. Each row that cannot be imported by the bulk-import operation is ignored and counted as one error. If *max_errors* is not specified, the default is 10.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The MAX_ERRORS option does not apply to constraint checks or to converting **money** and **bigint** data types.  
  
 ORDER ( { *column* [ ASC | DESC ] } [ **,**... *n* ] )  
 Specifies how the data in the data file is sorted. Bulk import performance is improved if the data being imported is sorted according to the clustered index on the table, if any. If the data file is sorted in a different order, that is other than the order of a clustered index key or if there is no clustered index on the table, the ORDER clause is ignored. The column names supplied must be valid column names in the destination table. By default, the bulk insert operation assumes the data file is unordered. For optimized bulk import, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] also validates that the imported data is sorted.  
  
 *n*  
 Is a placeholder that indicates that multiple columns can be specified.  
  
 ROWS_PER_BATCH **=***rows_per_batch*  
 Indicates the approximate number of rows of data in the data file.  
  
 By default, all the data in the data file is sent to the server as a single transaction, and the number of rows in the batch is unknown to the query optimizer. If you specify ROWS_PER_BATCH (with a value > 0) the server uses this value to optimize the bulk-import operation. The value specified for ROWS_PER_BATCH should approximately the same as the actual number of rows. For information about performance considerations, see "Remarks," later in this topic.  
  
 
 TABLOCK  
 Specifies that a table-level lock is acquired for the duration of the bulk-import operation. A table can be loaded concurrently by multiple clients if the table has no indexes and TABLOCK is specified. By default, locking behavior is determined by the table option **table lock on bulk load**. Holding a lock for the duration of the bulk-import operation reduces lock contention on the table, in some cases can significantly improve performance. For information about performance considerations, see "Remarks," later in this topic.  
  
 For columnstore index. the locking behaviour is different because it is internally divided into multiple rowsets.  Each thread loads data exclusively into each rowset by taking a X lock on the rowset allowing parallel data load with concurrent data load sessions. The use of TABLOCK option will cause thread to take an X lock on the table (unlike BU lock for traditional rowsets) which will prevent other concurrent threads to load data concurrently.  

### Input file format options
  
FORMAT **=** 'CSV'   
**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1.   
Specifies a comma separated values file compliant to the [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) standard.

FIELDQUOTE **=** 'field_quote'   
**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1.   
Specifies a character that will be used as the quote character in the CSV file. If not specified, the quote character (") will be used as the quote character as defined in the [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) standard.
  
 FORMATFILE **='***format_file_path***'**  
 Specifies the full path of a format file. A format file describes the data file that contains stored responses created by using the **bcp** utility on the same table or view. The format file should be used if:  
  
-   The data file contains greater or fewer columns than the table or view.  
  
-   The columns are in a different order.  
  
-   The column delimiters vary.  
  
-   There are other changes in the data format. Format files are typically created by using the **bcp** utility and modified with a text editor as needed. For more information, see [bcp Utility](../../tools/bcp-utility.md).  

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1.   
Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1, the format_file_path can be in Azure blob storage.

 FIELDTERMINATOR **='***field_terminator***'**  
 Specifies the field terminator to be used for **char** and **widechar** data files. The default field terminator is \t (tab character). For more information, see [Specify Field and Row Terminators &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/specify-field-and-row-terminators-sql-server.md).  

 ROWTERMINATOR **='***row_terminator***'**  
 Specifies the row terminator to be used for **char** and **widechar** data files. The default row terminator is **\r\n** (newline character).  For more information, see [Specify Field and Row Terminators &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/specify-field-and-row-terminators-sql-server.md).  

  
## Compatibility  
 BULK INSERT enforces strict data validation and data checks of data read from a file that could cause existing scripts to fail when they are executed on invalid data. For example, BULK INSERT verifies that:  
  
-   The native representations of **float** or **real** data types are valid.  
  
-   Unicode data has an even-byte length.  
  
## Data Types  
  
### String-to-Decimal Data Type Conversions  
 The string-to-decimal data type conversions used in BULK INSERT follow the same rules as the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] [CONVERT](../../t-sql/functions/cast-and-convert-transact-sql.md) function, which rejects strings representing numeric values that use scientific notation. Therefore, BULK INSERT treats such strings as invalid values and reports conversion errors.  
  
 To work around this behavior, use a format file to bulk import scientific notation **float** data into a decimal column. In the format file, explicitly describe the column as **real** or **float** data. For more information about these data types, see [float and real &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/data-types/float-and-real-transact-sql.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Format files represent **real** data as the **SQLFLT4** data type and **float** data as the **SQLFLT8** data type. For information about non-XML format files, see [Specify File Storage Type by Using bcp &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/specify-file-storage-type-by-using-bcp-sql-server.md).  
  
#### Example of Importing a Numeric Value that Uses Scientific Notation  
 This example uses the following table:  
  
```  
CREATE TABLE t_float(c1 float, c2 decimal (5,4));  
```  
  
 The user wants to bulk import data into the `t_float` table. The data file, C:\t_float-c.dat, contains scientific notation **float** data; for example:  
  
```  
8.0000000000000002E-28.0000000000000002E-2  
```  
  
 However, BULK INSERT cannot import this data directly into `t_float`, because its second column, `c2`, uses the `decimal` data type. Therefore, a format file is necessary. The format file must map the scientific notation **float** data to the decimal format of column `c2`.  
  
 The following format file uses the `SQLFLT8` data type to map the second data field to the second column:  
  
 `<?xml version="1.0"?>`  
  
 `<BCPFORMAT xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/bulkload/format" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">`  
  
 `<RECORD>`  
  
 `<FIELD ID="1" xsi:type="CharTerm" TERMINATOR="\t" MAX_LENGTH="30"/>`  
  
 `<FIELD ID="2" xsi:type="CharTerm" TERMINATOR="\r\n" MAX_LENGTH="30"/>  </RECORD>  <ROW>`  
  
 `<COLUMN SOURCE="1" NAME="c1" xsi:type="SQLFLT8"/>`  
  
 `<COLUMN SOURCE="2" NAME="c2" xsi:type="SQLFLT8"/>  </ROW> </BCPFORMAT>`  
  
 To use this format file (using the file name `C:\t_floatformat-c-xml.xml`) to import the test data into the test table, issue the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement:  
  
```  
BULK INSERT bulktest..t_float  
FROM 'C:\t_float-c.dat' WITH (FORMATFILE='C:\t_floatformat-c-xml.xml');  
GO  
```  
  
### Data Types for Bulk Exporting or Importing SQLXML Documents  
 To bulk export or import SQLXML data, use one of the following data types in your format file:  
  
|Data type|Effect|  
|---------------|------------|  
|SQLCHAR or SQLVARCHAR|The data is sent in the client code page or in the code page implied by the collation). The effect is the same as specifying the DATAFILETYPE **='char'** without specifying a format file.|  
|SQLNCHAR or SQLNVARCHAR|The data is sent as Unicode. The effect is the same as specifying the DATAFILETYPE **= 'widechar'** without specifying a format file.|  
|SQLBINARY or SQLVARBIN|The data is sent without any conversion.|  
  
## General Remarks  
 For a comparison of the BULK INSERT statement, the INSERT ... SELECT \* FROM OPENROWSET(BULK...) statement, and the **bcp** command, see [Bulk Import and Export of Data &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/bulk-import-and-export-of-data-sql-server.md).  
  
 For information about preparing data for bulk import, see [Prepare Data for Bulk Export or Import &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/prepare-data-for-bulk-export-or-import-sql-server.md).  
  
 The BULK INSERT statement can be executed within a user-defined transaction to import data into a table or view. Optionally, to use multiple matches for bulk importing data, a transaction can specify the BATCHSIZE clause in the BULK INSERT statement. If a multiple-batch transaction is rolled back, every batch that the transaction has sent to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is rolled back.  
  
## Interoperability  
  
### Importing Data from a CSV file  
Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1, BULK INSERT supports the CSV format.  
Before [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] CTP 1.1, comma-separated value (CSV) files are not supported by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] bulk-import operations. However, in some cases, a CSV file can be used as the data file for a bulk import of data into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For information about the requirements for importing data from a CSV data file, see [Prepare Data for Bulk Export or Import &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/prepare-data-for-bulk-export-or-import-sql-server.md).  
  
## Logging Behavior  
 For information about when row-insert operations that are performed by bulk import are logged in the transaction log, see [Prerequisites for Minimal Logging in Bulk Import](../../relational-databases/import-export/prerequisites-for-minimal-logging-in-bulk-import.md).  
  
##  <a name="Limitations"></a> Restrictions  
 When using a format file with BULK INSERT, you can specify up to 1024 fields only. This is same as the maximum number of columns allowed in a table. If you use BULK INSERT with a data file that contains more than 1024 fields, BULK INSERT generates the 4822 error. The [bcp utility](../../tools/bcp-utility.md) does not have this limitation, so for data files that contain more than 1024 fields, use the **bcp** command.  
  
## Performance Considerations  
 If the number of pages to be flushed in a single batch exceeds an internal threshold, a full scan of the buffer pool might occur to identify which pages to flush when the batch commits. This full scan can hurt bulk-import performance. A likely case of exceeding the internal threshold occurs when a large buffer pool is combined with a slow I/O subsystem. To avoid buffer overflows on large machines, either do not use the TABLOCK hint (which will remove the bulk optimizations) or use a smaller batch size (which preserves the bulk optimizations).  
  
 Because computers vary, we recommend that you test various batch sizes with your data load to find out what works best for you.  
  
## Security  
  
### Security Account Delegation (Impersonation)  
 If a user uses a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login, the security profile of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] process account is used. A login using SQL Server authentication cannot be authenticated outside of the Database Engine. Therefore, when a BULK INSERT command is initiated by a login using SQL Server authentication, the connection to the data is made using the security context of the SQL Server process account (the account used by the SQL Server Database Engine service). To successfully read the source data you must grant the account used by the SQL Server Database Engine, access to the source data.In contrast, if a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] user logs on by using Windows Authentication, the user can read only those files that can be accessed by the user account, regardless of the security profile of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] process.  
  
 When executing the BULK INSERT statement by using **sqlcmd** or **osql**, from one computer, inserting data into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a second computer, and specifying a *data_file* on third computer by using a UNC path, you may receive a 4861 error.  
  
 To resolve this error, use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication and specify a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login that uses the security profile of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] process account, or configure Windows to enable security account delegation. For information about how to enable a user account to be trusted for delegation, see Windows Help.  
  
 For more information about this and other security considerations for using BULK INSERT, see [Import Bulk Data by Using BULK INSERT or OPENROWSET&#40;BULK...&#41; &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/import-bulk-data-by-using-bulk-insert-or-openrowset-bulk...-sql-server.md).  
  
### Permissions  
 Requires INSERT and ADMINISTER BULK OPERATIONS permissions. Additionally, ALTER TABLE permission is required if one or more of the following is true:  
  
-   Constraints exist and the CHECK_CONSTRAINTS option is not specified.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Disabling constraints is the default behavior. To check constraints explicitly, use the CHECK_CONSTRAINTS option.  
  
-   Triggers exist and the FIRE_TRIGGER option is not specified.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  By default, triggers are not fired. To fire triggers explicitly, use the FIRE_TRIGGER option.  
  
-   You use the KEEPIDENTITY option to import identity value from data file.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using pipes to import data from a file  
 The following example imports order detail information into the `AdventureWorks2012.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` table from the specified data file by using a pipe (`|`) as the field terminator and `|\n` as the row terminator.  
  
```  
BULK INSERT AdventureWorks2012.Sales.SalesOrderDetail  
   FROM 'f:\orders\lineitem.tbl'  
   WITH   
      (  
         FIELDTERMINATOR =' |',  
         ROWTERMINATOR =' |\n'  
      );  
```  
  
### B. Using the FIRE_TRIGGERS argument  
 The following example specifies the `FIRE_TRIGGERS` argument.  
  
```  
BULK INSERT AdventureWorks2012.Sales.SalesOrderDetail  
   FROM 'f:\orders\lineitem.tbl'  
   WITH  
     (  
        FIELDTERMINATOR =' |',  
        ROWTERMINATOR = ':\n',  
        FIRE_TRIGGERS  
      );  
```  
  
### C. Using line feed as a row terminator  
 The following example imports a file that uses the line feed as a row terminator such as a UNIX output:  
  
```  
DECLARE @bulk_cmd varchar(1000);  
SET @bulk_cmd = 'BULK INSERT AdventureWorks2012.Sales.SalesOrderDetail  
FROM ''<drive>:\<path>\<filename>''   
WITH (ROWTERMINATOR = '''+CHAR(10)+''')';  
EXEC(@bulk_cmd);  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Due to how Microsoft Windows treats text files **(\n** automatically gets replaced with **\r\n)**.  
  
### D. Specifying a code page  
 The following example show how to specify a code page.  
  
```  
BULK INSERT MyTable  
FROM 'D:\data.csv'  
WITH  
( CODEPAGE = '65001',  
    DATAFILETYPE = 'char',  
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ','  
);  
```  
### E. Importing data from a CSV file   
The following example show how to specify a CSV file.   
```
BULK INSERT Sales.Invoices
FROM '\\share\invoices\inv-2016-07-25.csv'
WITH (FORMAT = 'CSV'); 
```

### F. Importing data from a file in Azure blob storage   
The following example shows how to load data from a csv file in an Azure blob storage location, which has been configured as an external data source. This requires a database scoped credential using a shared access signature.    

```tsql
BULK INSERT Sales.Invoices
FROM 'inv-2017-01-19.csv'
WITH (DATA_SOURCE = 'MyAzureInvoices',
     FORMAT = 'CSV'); 
```

For complete `BULK INSERT` examples including configuring the credential and external data source, see [Examples of Bulk Access to Data in Azure Blob Storage](../../relational-databases/import-export/examples-of-bulk-access-to-data-in-azure-blob-storage.md).
