# Start and Stop a Replication Agent (SQL Server Management Studio)
  Start and stop agents from the **Jobs** folder and the **Replication** folder in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and from Replication Monitor. Start and stop the following agents and jobs:  
  
-   The Snapshot Agent, which is used by all publications.  
  
-   The Log Reader Agent, which is used by all transactional publications.  
  
-   The Queue Reader Agent, which is used by transactional publications enabled for queued updating subscriptions.  
  
-   The Distribution Agent, which synchronizes subscriptions to transactional and snapshot publications.  
  
-   The Merge Agent, which synchronizes subscriptions to merge publications.  
  
-   Replication maintenance jobs.  
  
 For more information about starting the Merge Agent and the Distribution Agent, see [Synchronize a Push Subscription](../../../relational-databases/replication/synchronize-a-push-subscription.md) and [Synchronize a Pull Subscription](../../../relational-databases/replication/synchronize-a-pull-subscription.md). For more information about maintenance jobs, see [Run Replication Maintenance Jobs &#40;SQL Server Management Studio&#41;](../../../relational-databases/replication/administration/run-replication-maintenance-jobs-sql-server-management-studio.md).  
  
 For information about starting Replication Monitor, see [Start the Replication Monitor](../../../relational-databases/replication/monitor/start-the-replication-monitor.md).
