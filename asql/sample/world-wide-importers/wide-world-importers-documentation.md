# Wide World Importers Documentation
Wide World Importers is the new sample database for SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database. It illustrates the core capabilities of SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database, for transaction processing (OLTP), data warehousing and analytics (OLAP) workloads, as well as hybrid transaction and analytics processing (HTAP) workloads.

## About this sample

Wide World Importers is a comprehensive database sample that both illustrates database design, and illustrates how SQL Server features can be leveraged in an application.

Note that the sample is meant to be representative of a typical database. It does not include every feature of SQL Server. The design of the database follows one common set of standards, but there are many ways one might build a database.
