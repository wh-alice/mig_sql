[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../integration-services/system/stored-procedures/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
DENY permission [ ,...n ] ON  
        SEARCH PROPERTY LIST :: search_property_list_name  
    TO database_principal [ ,...n ] [ CASCADE ]  
    [ AS denying_principal ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *permission*  
 Is the name of a permission. The valid mappings of permissions to securables are described in the "Remarks" section, later in this topic.  
  
 ON SEARCH PROPERTY LIST **::***search_property_list_name*  
 Specifies the search property list on which the permission is being denied. The scope qualifier :: is required.  
  
 *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is being denied. The principal can be one of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being denied is also denied to other principals to which it has been granted by this principal.  
  
 *denying_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to deny the permission. The principal can be one of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
## Remarks  
  
## SEARCH PROPERTY LIST Permissions  
 A search property list is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on a search property list are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Search property list permission|Implied by search property list permission|Implied by database permission|  
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY FULLTEXT CATALOG|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the full-text catalog. If using the AS option, the specified principal must own the full-text catalog.
