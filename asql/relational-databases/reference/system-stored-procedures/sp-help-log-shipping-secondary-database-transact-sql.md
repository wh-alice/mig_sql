[ @secondary_database = ] 'secondary_database' OR  
[ @secondary_id = ] 'secondary_id'  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@secondary_database =** ] '*secondary_database*'  
 Is the name of the secondary database. *secondary_database* is **sysname**, with no default.  
  
 [ **@secondary_id =** ] '*secondary_id*'  
 The ID for the secondary server in the log shipping configuration. *secondary_id* is **uniqueidentifier** and cannot be NULL.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 0 (success) or 1 (failure)

|**backup_destination_directory**|The directory on the secondary server where backup files are copied to.|  
|**file_retention_period**|The length of time, in minutes, that a backup file is retained on the secondary server before being deleted.|  
|**copy_job_id**|The ID associated with the copy job on the secondary server.|  
|**restore_job_id**|The ID associated with the restore job on the secondary server.|  
|**monitor_server**|The name of the instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] being used as a monitor server in the log shipping configuration.|

|**last_restored_latency**|The amount of time, in minutes, that elapsed between when the log backup was created on the primary and when it was restored on the secondary.<br /><br /> The initial value is NULL.|  
  
## Remarks  
 If you include the *secondary_database* parameter, the result set will contain information about that secondary database; if you include the *secondary_id* parameter, the result set will contain information about all secondary databases associated with that secondary ID.  
  
 **sp_help_log_shipping_secondary_database** must be run from the **master** database on the secondary server.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can run this procedure.
