# Image Properties Dialog Box, General (Report Builder and SSRS)
  Select **General** on the **Image Properties** dialog box to add a picture, change the default name of the image, and add ToolTip text.  
  
## Options  
 **Name**  
 Type a name for the item. The name must be unique within the report. By default, a general name, such as Image1 or Image2, is assigned.  
  
 **Tooltip**  
 Type text or an expression that evaluates to a ToolTip. Click the Expression (*fx*) button to edit the expression. The **Tooltip** appears when the user pauses the pointer over the item in an HTML report.  
  
 **Select the image source**  
 Indicate where the image is stored so that when the report is rendered, the report processor will know where to get the image from.  
  
-   **External** Choose this option when you want the image to continue to exist as a file on a report server or Web server.  
  
-   **Embedded** Choose this option when you want to embed the image into the report.  
  
-   **Database** Choose this option when you want to include a database field name that represents the images that you want to include in your report.  
  
 **Use this image**  
 This option appears when you select the **Embedded** or **External** option.  
  
 If you are embedding the image, choose the image that you want to add to the report from the drop-down list. Click the **Import** button to add the image to the drop-down list.  
  
 If you select the **External** option, type the URL of the image. For a report published to a report server configured for native mode, use a full or relative path. For example, http://\<servername>/images/image1.jpg. For a report published to a report server configured in SharePoint integrated mode, use a fully qualified URL. For example, http://\<*SharePointservername*>/\<*site*>/Documents/images/image1.jpg.  
  
 **Import**  
 Click to add an image to the **Use this image** drop-down list.  
  
 **Use this field**  
 This option appears if you select the **Database** option. Select the field name.  
  
 **Use this MIME type**  
 Choose the appropriate format of the images contained in the database, for example, .bmp, .jpeg, .gif, .png, and .x-png.
