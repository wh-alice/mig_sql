# Dependent Items Page (Report Manager)
  Use the Dependent Items page to view a list of reports and models that reference a shared data source. The icon for each item type indicates whether it is a report or a model. This page can be viewed in list view or details view. Use details view to show more information about each item. Additional page options are available in details view. To help you manage the shared data source, this page provides links to reports and models that use the data source, metrics on when the report or model was last run or modified, and Delete and Move buttons so that you can easily remove reports and models that are no longer used, or move them to a different location while you determine whether they are still needed.
