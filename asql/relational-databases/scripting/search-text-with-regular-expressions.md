# Search Text with Regular Expressions
  Regular expressions are a concise and flexible notation for finding and replacing patterns of text. A specific set of regular expressions can be used in the **Find what** field of the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] **Find and Replace** dialog box.  
  
#### To find using regular expressions  
  
1.  To enable the use of regular expressions in the **Find what** field during **QuickFind**, **FindinFiles**, **Quick Replace**, or **Replace in Files** operations, select the **Use** option under **Find Options**and choose **Regular expressions**.  
  
2.  The triangular **Reference List** button next to the **Find what** field then becomes available. Click this button to display a list of the most commonly used regular expressions. When you choose any item from the Expression Builder, it is inserted into the **Find what** string.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  There are syntax differences between the regular expressions that can be used in **Find what** strings and those that are valid in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework programming. For example, in **Find and Replace**, the braces notation {} is used for tagged expressions. So the expression "zo{1}" matches all occurrences of "zo" followed by the tag 1, as in "Alonzo1" and "Gonzo1". But within the .NET Framework, the notation {} is used for quantifiers. So the expression "zo{1}" matches all occurrences of "z" followed by exactly one "o", as in "zone" but not "zoo".  
  
 The following table describes the regular expressions available in the **Reference List**.  
  
|Expression|Syntax|Description|  
|----------------|------------|-----------------|  
|Any character|.|Matches any single character except a line break.|  
|Zero or more|*|Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding expression, making all possible matches.|  
|One or more|+|Matches at least one occurrence of the preceding expression.|  
|Beginning of line|^|Anchors the match string to the beginning of a line.|  
|End of line|$|Anchors the match string to the end of a line.|  
|Beginning of word|\<|Matches only when a word begins at this point in the text.|  
|End of word|>|Matches only when a word ends at this point in the text.|  
|Line break|\n|Matches a platform-independent line break. In a Replace expression, inserts a line break.|  
|Any one character in the set|[]|Matches any one of the characters within the []. To specify a range of characters, list the starting and ending character separated by a dash (-), as in [a-z].|  
|Any one character not in the set|[^...]|Matches any character not in the set of characters following the ^.|  
|Or|&#124;|Matches either the expression before or the one after the OR symbol (&#124;). Mostly used within a group. For example, (sponge&#124;mud) bath matches "sponge bath" and "mud bath."|  
|Escape|\|Matches the character that follows the backslash (\\) as a literal. This allows you to find the characters used in regular expression notation, such as { and ^. For example, \\^ Searches for the ^ character.|  
|Tagged expression|{}|Matches text tagged with the enclosed expression.|  
|C/C++ Identifier|:i|Matches the expression ([a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z0-9_$]*).|  
|Quoted string|:q|Matches the expression (("[^"]*")&#124;('[^']\*')).|  
|Space or Tab|:b|Matches either space or tab characters.|  
|Integer|:z|Matches the expression ([0-9]+).|  
  
 The list of all regular expressions that are valid in **Find and Replace** operations is longer than can be displayed in the **Reference List**. You can also insert any of the following regular expressions into a **Find what** string:  
  
|Expression|Syntax|Description|  
|----------------|------------|-----------------|  
|Minimal — zero or more|@|Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding expression, matching as few characters as possible.|  
|Minimal — one or more|#|Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding expression, matching as few characters as possible.|  
|Repeat n times|^n|Matches n occurrences of the preceding expression. For example, [0-9]^4 matches any 4-digit sequence.|  
|Grouping|()|Groups a subexpression.|  
|nth tagged text|\n|In a **Find or Replace** expression, indicates the text matched by the nth tagged expression, where n is a number from 1 to 9.<br /><br /> In a **Replace** expression, \0 inserts the entire matched text.|  
|Right-justified field|\\(w,n)|In a **Replace** expression, right-justifies the nth tagged expression in a field at least *w* characters wide.|  
|Left-justified field|\\(-w,n)|In a **Replace** expression, left-justifies the nth tagged expression in a field at least *w* characters wide.|  
|Prevent match|~(X)|Prevents a match when X appears at this point in the expression. For example, real~(ity) matches the "real" in "realty" and "really," but not the "real" in "reality."|  
|Alphanumeric character|:a|Matches the expression ([a-zA-Z0-9]).|  
|Alphabetic character|:c|Matches the expression ([a-zA-Z]).|  
|Decimal digit|:d|Matches the expression ([0-9]).|  
|Hexadecimal digit|:h|Matches the expression ([0-9a-fA-F]+).|  
|Rational number|:n|Matches the expression (([0-9]+.[0-9]*)&#124;([0-9]\*.[0-9]+)&#124;([0-9]+)).|  
|Alphabetic string|:w|Matches the expression ([a-zA-Z]+).|  
|Escape|\e|Unicode U+001B.|  
|Bell|\g|Unicode U+0007.|  
|Backspace|\h|Unicode U+0008.|  
|Tab|\t|Matches a tab character, Unicode U+0009.|  
|Unicode character|\x#### or \u####|Matches a character given by Unicode value where #### is hexadecimal digits. You can specify a character outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (that is, a surrogate) with the ISO 10646 code point or with two Unicode code points giving the values of the surrogate pair.|  
  
 The following table lists the syntax for matching by standard Unicode character properties. The two-letter abbreviation is the same as listed in the Unicode character properties database. These may be specified as part of a character set. For example, the expression [:Nd:Nl:No] matches any kind of digit.

|Uppercase letter|:Lu|Matches any one upper case letter. For example, :Luhe matches "The" but not "the".|
