[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Adds a new job executed by the SQLServerAgent service.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_add_job [ @job_name = ] 'job_name'  
     [ , [ @enabled = ] enabled ]   
     [ , [ @description = ] 'description' ]   
     [ , [ @start_step_id = ] step_id ]   
     [ , [ @category_name = ] 'category' ]   
     [ , [ @category_id = ] category_id ]   
     [ , [ @owner_login_name = ] 'login' ]   
     [ , [ @notify_level_eventlog = ] eventlog_level ]   
     [ , [ @notify_level_email = ] email_level ]   
     [ , [ @notify_level_netsend = ] netsend_level ]   
     [ , [ @notify_level_page = ] page_level ]   
     [ , [ @notify_email_operator_name = ] 'email_name' ]   
          [ , [ @notify_netsend_operator_name = ] 'netsend_name' ]   
     [ , [ @notify_page_operator_name = ] 'page_name' ]   
     [ , [ @delete_level = ] delete_level ]   
     [ , [ @job_id = ] job_id OUTPUT ]   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@job_name =** ] **'***job_name***'**  
 The name of the job. The name must be unique and cannot contain the percent (**%**) character. *job_name*is **nvarchar(128)**, with no default.  
  
 [ **@enabled =** ] *enabled*  
 Indicates the status of the added job. *enabled*is **tinyint**, with a default of 1 (enabled). If **0**, the job is not enabled and does not run according to its schedule; however, it can be run manually.  
  
 [ **@description =** ] **'***description***'**  
 The description of the job. *description* is **nvarchar(512)**, with a default of NULL. If *description* is omitted, "No description available" is used.  
  
 [ **@start_step_id =** ] *step_id*  
 The identification number of the first step to execute for the job. *step_id*is **int**, with a default of 1.  
  
 [ **@category_name =** ] **'***category***'**  
 The category for the job. *category*is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@category_id =** ] *category_id*  
 A language-independent mechanism for specifying a job category. *category_id*is **int**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@owner_login_name =** ] **'***login***'**  
 The name of the login that owns the job. *login*is **sysname**, with a default of NULL, which is interpreted as the current login name. Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can set or change the value for **@owner_login_name**. If users who are not members of the **sysadmin** role set or change the value of **@owner_login_name**, execution of this stored procedure fails and an error is returned.  
  
 [ **@notify_level_eventlog =** ] *eventlog_level*  
 A value indicating when to place an entry in the Microsoft Windows application log for this job. *eventlog_level*is **int**, and can be one of these values.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**0**|Never|  
|**1**|On success|  
|**2** (default)|On failure|  
|**3**|Always|  
  
 [ **@notify_level_email =** ] *email_level*  
 A value that indicates when to send an e-mail upon the completion of this job. *email_level*is **int**, with a default of **0**, which indicates never. *email_level*uses the same values as *eventlog_level*.  
  
 [ **@notify_level_netsend =** ] *netsend_level*  
 A value that indicates when to send a network message upon the completion of this job. *netsend_level*is **int**, with a default of **0**, which indicates never. *netsend_level* uses the same values as *eventlog_level*.  
  
 [ **@notify_level_page =** ] *page_level*  
 A value that indicates when to send a page upon the completion of this job. *page_level*is **int**, with a default of **0**, which indicates never. *page_level*uses the same values as *eventlog_level*.  
  
 [ **@notify_email_operator_name =** ] **'***email_name***'**  
 The e-mail name of the person to send e-mail to when *email_level* is reached. *email_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@notify_netsend_operator_name =** ] **'***netsend_name***'**  
 The name of the operator to whom the network message is sent upon completion of this job. *netsend_name*is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@notify_page_operator_name =** ] **'***page_name***'**  
 The name of the person to page upon completion of this job. *page_name*is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@delete_level =** ] *delete_level*  
 A value that indicates when to delete the job. *delete_value*is **int**, with a default of 0, which means never. *delete_level*uses the same values as *eventlog_level*.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When *delete_level* is **3**, the job is executed only once, regardless of any schedules defined for the job. Furthermore, if a job deletes itself, all history for the job is also deleted.  
  
 [ **@job_id =** ] *job_id***OUTPUT**  
 The job identification number assigned to the job if created successfully. *job_id*is an output variable of type **uniqueidentifier**, with a default of NULL.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Result Sets  
 None  
  
## Remarks  
 **@originating_server** exists in **sp_add_job,** but is not listed under Arguments. **@originating_server** is reserved for internal use.  
  
 After **sp_add_job** has been executed to add a job, **sp_add_jobstep** can be used to add steps that perform the activities for the job. **sp_add_jobschedule** can be used to create the schedule that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service uses to execute the job. Use **sp_add_jobserver** to set the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance where the job executes, and **sp_delete_jobserver** to remove the job from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.  
  
 If the job will execute on one or more target servers in a multiserver environment, use **sp_apply_job_to_targets** to set the target servers or target server groups for the job. To remove jobs from target servers or target server groups, use **sp_remove_job_from_targets**.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] provides an easy, graphical way to manage jobs, and is the recommended way to create and manage the job infrastructure.  
  
## Permissions  
 To run this stored procedure, users must be a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role, or be granted one of the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent fixed database roles, which reside in the **msdb** database:  
  
-   **SQLAgentUserRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentReaderRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentOperatorRole**  
  
 For information about the specific permissions that are associated with each of these fixed database roles, see [SQL Server Agent Fixed Database Roles](../Topic/SQL%20Server%20Agent%20Fixed%20Database%20Roles.md).  
  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can set or change the value for **@owner_login_name**. If users who are not members of the **sysadmin** role set or change the value of **@owner_login_name**, execution of this stored procedure fails and an error is returned.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Adding a job  
 This example adds a new job named `NightlyBackups`.  
  
```  
USE msdb ;  
GO  
  
EXEC dbo.sp_add_job  
    @job_name = N'NightlyBackups' ;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Adding a job with pager, e-mail, and net send information  
 This example creates a job named `Ad hoc Sales Data Backup` that notifies `François Ajenstat` (by pager, e-mail, or network pop-up message) if the job fails, and deletes the job upon successful completion.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This example assumes that an operator named `François Ajenstat` and a login named `françoisa` already exist.  
  
```  
USE msdb ;  
GO  
  
EXEC dbo.sp_add_job  
    @job_name = N'Ad hoc Sales Data Backup',   
    @enabled = 1,  
    @description = N'Ad hoc backup of sales data',  
    @owner_login_name = N'françoisa',  
    @notify_level_eventlog = 2,  
    @notify_level_email = 2,  
    @notify_level_netsend = 2,  
    @notify_level_page = 2,  
    @notify_email_operator_name = N'François Ajenstat',  
    @notify_netsend_operator_name = N'François Ajenstat',   
    @notify_page_operator_name = N'François Ajenstat',  
    @delete_level = 1 ;  
GO  
```
