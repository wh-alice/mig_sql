# Deprecated and Discontinued SQL Server Features in SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This topic describes the deprecated features that are still available in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)], and describes discontinued features that are no longer available after you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
 The deprecated features are scheduled to be removed in a future release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Deprecated features should not be used in new applications.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../a9notintoc/includes/sssql15-md.md)] is a 64-bit application. 32-bit installation is discontinued, though some elements run as 32-bit components.  
  
-   For [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] features, see [Deprecated Database Engine Features in SQL Server 2016](../database-engine/deprecated-database-engine-features-in-sql-server-2016.md).  
  
-   For [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] replication features, see [Deprecated Features in SQL Server Replication](../relational-databases/replication/deprecated-features-in-sql-server-replication.md).
