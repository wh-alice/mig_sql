# Queries Events Data Columns
  The Queries Events event category has the following event classes:  
  
|**Event ID**|**Event Name**|**Event Description**|  
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|  
|9|Query Begin|Query begin.|  
|10|Query End|Query end.|  
  
 The following tables list the data columns for each of these event classes.  
  
## Query Begin Class—Data Columns  
  
|**Column Name**|**Column Id**|**Column Type**|**Column Description**|  
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|  
|EventClass|0|1|Event Class is used to categorize events.|  
|EventSubclass|1|1|Event Subclass provides additional information about each event class.<br /><br /> 0: MDXQuery<br /><br /> 1: DMXQuery<br /><br /> 2: SQLQuery<br /><br /> 3: DAXQuery|  
|CurrentTime|2|5|Contains the current time of the event, when available. For filtering, expected formats are 'YYYY-MM-DD' and 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.|  
|StartTime|3|5|Contains the time at which the event started, when available. For filtering, expected formats are 'YYYY-MM-DD' and 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.|  
|ConnectionID|25|1|Contains the unique connection ID associated with the query event.|  
|DatabaseName|28|8|Contains the name of the database in which the query is running.|  
|NTUserName|32|8|Contains the Windows user name associated with the query event.|  
|NTDomainName|33|8|Contains the Windows domain account associated with the query event.|  
|ClientProcessID|36|1|Contains the process ID of the client application.|  
|ApplicationName|37|8|Contains the name of the client application that created the connection to the server. This column is populated with the values passed by the application rather than the displayed name of the program.|  
|SessionID|39|8|Contains the session unique ID of the XMLA request.|  
|NTCanonicalUserName|40|8|Contains the Windows user name associated with the query event. The user name is in canonical form. For example, engineering.microsoft.com/software/user.|  
|SPID|41|1|Contains the server process ID (SPID) that uniquely identifies the user session associated with the query event. The SPID directly corresponds to the session GUID used by XMLA.|  
|TextData|42|9|Contains the text data associated with the query event.|  
|ServerName|43|8|Contains the name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] on which the query event occurred.|  
|RequestParameters|44|9|Contains the parameters for parameterized queries and commands associated with the query event.|  
|RequestProperties|45|9|Contains the properties of the XMLA request.|
