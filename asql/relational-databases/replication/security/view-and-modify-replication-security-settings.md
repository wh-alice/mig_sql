# View and Modify Replication Security Settings
  This topic describes how to view and modify replication security settings in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)], or Replication Management Objects (RMO). For example, you might want to change the connection of the Log Reader Agent to the Publisher from SQL Server Authentication to Windows Integrated Authentication, or you might need to change the credentials used to run an agent job when the Windows account password has changed. For information about the permissions required by each agent, see [Replication Agent Security Model](../../../relational-databases/replication/security/replication-agent-security-model.md).

-   The RMO classes and properties you use depend on the type of agent and the type of server connection.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
 For security reasons, the actual values of passwords are masked in result sets returned by replication stored procedures.  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
 View and modify security settings in the following dialog boxes:  
  
1.  The **Update Replication Passwords** dialog box, which is available from the **Replication** folder of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. If you change the password for a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] account or Windows account on a server in a replication topology, use this dialog box rather than updating the password for each agent that uses the account. If agents on more than one server use the same account, you must connect to each server and change the password. The password is updated in all of the places that replication uses the password. The password is not updated in other places, such as linked servers.  
  
2.  The **Agent Security** page of the **Publication Properties - \<Publication>** dialog box. For more information about accessing this dialog box, see [View and Modify Publication Properties](../../../relational-databases/replication/publish/view-and-modify-publication-properties.md).  
  
3.  The **Subscription Properties - \<Subscription>** dialog box. For more information about accessing this dialog box, see [View and Modify Push Subscription Properties](../../../relational-databases/replication/view-and-modify-push-subscription-properties.md) and [View and Modify Pull Subscription Properties](../../../relational-databases/replication/view-and-modify-pull-subscription-properties.md).  
  
4.  The **Distributor Properties - \<Distributor>** and **Distribution Database Properties - \<Database>** dialog boxes. For more information about accessing these dialog boxes, see [View and Modify Distributor and Publisher Properties](../../../relational-databases/replication/view-and-modify-distributor-and-publisher-properties.md).  
  
5.  The **Publisher Properties - \<Publisher>** dialog box. For more information about accessing this dialog box, [View and Modify Distributor and Publisher Properties](../../../relational-databases/replication/view-and-modify-distributor-and-publisher-properties.md).  
  
#### To change the password for an account used by one or more agents  
  
1.  If the account is a SQL Server account, this dialog box will also change the password for the SQL Server account. If the account is a Windows account, change the password in Windows first. For more information, see the Windows documentation.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  After changing a replication password, you must stop and restart each agent that uses the password before the change takes effect for that agent.  
  
2.  Connect to the server in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], and then expand the server node.  
  
3.  Right-click the **Replication** folder, and then click **Update Replication Passwords**.  
  
4.  In the **Update Replication Passwords** dialog box, specify the account and the new password.  
  
5.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
#### To change security settings for the Snapshot Agent  
  
1.  On the **Agent Security** page of the **Publication Properties - \<Publication>** dialog box, click the **Security Settings** button next to the **Snapshot Agent** text box.

Select this option if you have defined a remote server or linked server between the Subscriber and the Publisher using [sp_addserver &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addserver-transact-sql.md), [sp_addlinkedserver &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addlinkedserver-transact-sql.md), [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], or another method.  
  
    -   **Use SQL Server Authentication with the following login and password**. Select this option if you have not defined a remote server or linked server between the Subscriber and the Publisher. Replication will create a linked server for you. The account you specify must already exist at the Publisher.  
  
3.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This procedure changes the method that replication triggers use to connect from the Subscriber to the Publisher when changes are made at the Subscriber. You can also change settings associated with the Distribution Agent for an immediate updating subscription. For more information, see the procedures earlier in this topic.  
>   
>  This procedure applies only to pull subscriptions. For push subscriptions, use the stored procedure [sp_link_publication &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-link-publication-transact-sql.md).  
  
#### To change the password for the administrative connection from the Publisher to the Distributor  
  
1.  On the **Publishers** page of the **Distributor Properties - \<Distributor>** dialog box, enter a strong password in the **Password** and **Confirm Password** text boxes.  
  
2.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
3.  On the **General** page of the **Publisher Properties - \<Publisher>** dialog box, enter a strong password in the **Password** and **Confirm Password** text boxes.

#### To change security settings for the Merge Agent for a pull subscription  
  
1.  At the Subscriber, execute [sp_helpmergepullsubscription](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-helpmergepullsubscription-transact-sql.md), specifying **@publication**. This returns subscription properties, including security settings for the Merge Agent running at the Subscriber.  
  
2.  At the Subscriber on the subscription database, execute [sp_change_subscription_properties](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-change-subscription-properties-transact-sql.md), specifying **@publisher**, **@publisher_db**, **@publication**, the name of the security property for **@property**, and the new value of the property for **@value**.  
  
3.  Repeat step 2 for each of the following security properties being changed:  
  
    -   To change the Windows account under which the agent runs or just the password for this account, specify a value of **merge_job_password** for **@property** and new password for **@value**. When changing the account itself, repeat Step 2 specifying a value of **merge_job_login** for **@property** and the new Windows account for **@value**.  
  
    -   To change the security mode used when connecting to the Distributor, specify a value of **distributor_security_mode** for **@property** and a value of **1** (Windows Integrated Authentication) or **0** (SQL Server Authentication) for **@value**.  
  
    -   When changing the Distributor security mode to SQL Server Authentication or if changing login information for SQL Server Authentication, specify a value of **distributor_password** for **@property** and the new password for **@value**. Repeat step 2, specifying a value of **distributor_login** for **@property** and the new login for **@value**.  
  
    -   To change the security mode used when connecting to the Publisher, specify a value of **publisher_security_mode** for **@property** and a value of **1** (Windows Integrated Authentication) or **0** (SQL Server Authentication) for **@value**.  
  
    -   When changing the Publisher security mode to SQL Server Authentication or if changing login information for SQL Server Authentication, specify a value of **publisher_password** for **@property** and the new password for **@value**. Repeat step 2, specifying a value of **publisher_login** for **@property** and the new login for **@value**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  After changing an agent login or password, you must stop and restart the agent before the change takes effect.  
  
#### To change security settings for the Snapshot Agent to generate a filtered snapshot for a Subscriber  
  
1.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_helpdynamicsnapshot_job](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-helpdynamicsnapshot-job-transact-sql.md), specifying **@publication**. In the result set, note the value of **job_name** for the Subscriber's partition to change.  
  
2.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_changedynamicsnapshot_job](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-changedynamicsnapshot-job-transact-sql.md), specifying **@publication**, the value obtained from step 1 for **@dynamic_snapshot_jobname**, and a new password for **@job_password** or login and password for the Windows account under which the agent runs for **@job_login** and **@job_password**.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  When configuring a Publisher with a remote Distributor, the values supplied for all parameters, including *job_login* and *job_password*, are sent to the Distributor as plain text. You should encrypt the connection between the Publisher and its remote Distributor before executing this stored procedure. For more information, see [Enable Encrypted Connections to the Database Engine &#40;SQL Server Configuration Manager&#41;](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/enable-encrypted-connections-to-the-database-engine.md).  
  
#### To change security settings for the Queue Reader Agent  
  
1.  At the Distributor, execute [sp_helpqreader_agent](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-helpqreader-agent-transact-sql.md). This returns the current Windows account under which the Queue Reader Agent runs.  
  
    -   At the Distributor, execute [sp_changeqreader_agent](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-changeqreader-agent-transact-sql.md), specifying the Windows account settings for **@job_login** and **@job_passwsord**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  After changing an agent login or password, you must stop and restart the agent before the change takes effect. There is one Queue Reader Agent for each distribution database. Changing the security settings for the agent affects the settings for all publications at all Publishers that use this distribution database.  
  
2.  The Queue Reader Agent makes connections to the Subscriber using the same connection context as the Distribution Agent for the subscription.  
  
#### To change security mode used by an immediate updating Subscriber when connecting to the Publisher  
  
1.  At the Subscriber on the subscription database, execute [sp_link_publication](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-link-publication-transact-sql.md). Specify **@publisher**, **@publication**, the name of the publication database for **@publisher_db**, and one of the following values for **@security_mode**:  
  
    -   **0** to use SQL Server Authentication when making updates at the Publisher. This option requires you to specify a valid login at the Publisher for **@login** and **@password**.  
  
    -   **1** to use the security context of the user making changes at the Subscriber when connecting to the Publisher. See [sp_link_publication](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-link-publication-transact-sql.md) for restrictions related to this security mode.  
  
    -   **2** to use an existing, user-defined linked server login created using [sp_addlinkedserver &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addlinkedserver-transact-sql.md).  
  
#### To change the password for a remote Distributor  
  
1.  At the Distributor on the distribution database, execute [sp_changedistributor_password](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-changedistributor-password-transact-sql.md), specifying the new password for this login for **@password**.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Do not change the password for **distributor_admin** directly.  
  
2.  At every Publisher that uses this remote Distributor, execute [sp_changedistributor_password](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-changedistributor-password-transact-sql.md), specifying the password from step 1 for **@password**.
