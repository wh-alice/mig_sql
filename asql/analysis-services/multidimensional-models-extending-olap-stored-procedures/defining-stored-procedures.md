# Defining Stored Procedures
  You can use stored procedures to call external routines from [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. You can write an external routines called by a stored procedure in any common language runtime (CLR) language, such as C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, or Visual Basic .NET. A stored procedure can be created once and called from many contexts, such as other stored procedures, calculated measures, or client applications. Stored procedures simplify [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database development and implementation by allowing common code to be developed once and stored in a single location. Stored procedures can be used to add business functionality to your applications that is not provided by the native functionality of MDX.  
  
 This section provides the information necessary to understand, design, and implement stored procedures.
