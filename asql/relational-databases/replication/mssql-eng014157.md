# MSSQL_ENG014157
    
## Message Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|14157|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|[!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]|  
|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|The subscription created by Subscriber '%s' to publication '%s' has expired and has been dropped.|  
  
## Explanation  
 A Subscriber must synchronize with the Publisher within the time specified in the publication retention period. If a Subscriber does not synchronize within this period, the subscription expires. For more information, see [Subscription Expiration and Deactivation](../../relational-databases/replication/subscription-expiration-and-deactivation.md).  
  
## User Action  
 The subscription must be re-created and initialized before the Subscriber can begin receiving data changes again:  
  
-   For information about creating subscriptions, see [Subscribe to Publications](../../relational-databases/replication/subscribe-to-publications.md).  
  
-   For information about initializing subscriptions, see [Initialize a Subscription](../../relational-databases/replication/initialize-a-subscription.md).  
  
 If the subscription database contains changes that have not been synchronized with the Publisher, you can use the [tablediff Utility](../../tools/tablediff-utility.md) to determine which rows are different in the publication and subscription databases.  
  
 You can increase the publication retention period to avoid having subscriptions expire. Use caution in setting a high value, because this can result in more data and metadata being stored, which affects performance. For more information, see [Subscription Expiration and Deactivation](../../relational-databases/replication/subscription-expiration-and-deactivation.md).
