  The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] component of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is the core service for storing, processing, and securing data. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] provides controlled access and rapid transaction processing to meet the requirements of the most demanding data consuming applications in your enterprise.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports up to 50 instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] on a single computer. To create a typical [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation, see [Install SQL Server 2016 from the Installation Wizard &#40;Setup&#41;](../../../database-engine/install/windows/install-sql-server-from-the-installation-wizard-setup.md).  
  
 **Important** For local installations, you must run Setup as an administrator. If you install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] from a remote share, you must use a domain account that has read and execute permissions on the remote share.  
  
 The following features are installed when you select **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Database Engine** on the Components to Install page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Wizard:

You will have to perform additional steps post installation to install DQS server. For more information, see [Install Data Quality Services](../../../data-quality-services/install/windows/install-data-quality-services.md).
