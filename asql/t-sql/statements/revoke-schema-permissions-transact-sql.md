# REVOKE Schema Permissions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Revokes permissions on a schema.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
REVOKE [ GRANT OPTION FOR ] permission  [ ,...n ]   
    ON SCHEMA :: schema_name   
    { TO | FROM } database_principal [ ,...n ]  
    [ CASCADE ]  
    [ AS revoking_principal ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be revoked on a schema. The permissions that can be revoked on a schema are listed in the "Remarks" section, later in this topic.  
  
 GRANT OPTION FOR  
 Indicates that the right to grant the specified right to other principals will be revoked. The permission itself will not be revoked.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If the principal has the specified permission without the GRANT option, the permission itself will be revoked.  
  
 ON SCHEMA **::** schema*_name*  
 Specifies the schema on which the permission is being revoked. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal from which the permission is being revoked. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being revoked is also revoked from other principals to which it has been granted by this principal.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  Indicates that the permission being revoked is also revoked from other principals to which it has been granted or denied by this principal.  
  
 AS *revoking_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to revoke the permission. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
## Remarks  
 A schema is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be revoked on a schema are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Schema permission|Implied by schema permission|Implied by database permission|  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY SCHEMA|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|CREATE SEQUENCE|ALTER|ALTER ANY SCHEMA|  
|DELETE|CONTROL|DELETE|  
|EXECUTE|CONTROL|EXECUTE|  
|INSERT|CONTROL|INSERT|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|SELECT|CONTROL|SELECT|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|UPDATE|CONTROL|UPDATE|  
|VIEW CHANGE TRACKING|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the schema.
