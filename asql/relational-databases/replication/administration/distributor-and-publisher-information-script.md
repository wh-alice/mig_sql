# Distributor and Publisher Information Script
  This script uses system tables and replication stored procedures to answer questions commonly asked about objects at the Distributor and Publisher. The script can be used "as-is" and can also provide the basis for customized scripts. The script might require two modifications to run in your environment:  
  
-   Change the line `use AdventureWorks2012` to use the name of your publication database.  
  
-   Remove the comments (`--`) from the line `exec sp_helparticle @publication='<PublicationName>'` and replace \<PublicationName> with the name of a publication.  
  
```

FROM sys.views WHERE is_schema_published = 1;  
  
--Which columns are published in snapshot or transactional publications in this database?  
SELECT object_name(object_id) AS tran_published_table, name AS published_column FROM sys.columns WHERE is_replicated = 1;  
  
--Which columns are published in merge publications in this database?  
SELECT object_name(object_id) AS merge_published_table, name AS published_column FROM sys.columns WHERE is_merge_published = 1;
