# Working with SSMA for Oracle Console (DB2ToSQL)
MicrosoftSQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) release for DB2 is now accessible through a console application at command line. The script files form the input to the application for executing the commands. As a console application, SSMA enables script-level interfacing, reduces the migration cycle, and scales the migration effort.  
  
This section explains the procedure to migrate the DB2 database using the SSMA Console application.
