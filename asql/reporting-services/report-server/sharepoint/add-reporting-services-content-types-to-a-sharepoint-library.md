# Add Reporting Services Content Types to a SharePoint Library
  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] provides predefined SharePoint content types that are used to manage shared data source (.rsds) files, report models (.smdl), and Report Builder report definition (.rdl) files. Adding a **Report Builder Report**, **Report Model**, and **Report Data Source** content type to a library enables the **New** command so that you can create new documents of that type.  
  
 **[!INCLUDE[applies](../../../analysis-services/includes/applies-md.md)]**  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint mode  
  
 To add content types to a library, you must be a site administrator or have Full Control level of permission.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] content types and content type management will automatically be enabled in all document libraries for existing site collections created from the following site template types:  
  
-   **Business Intelligence Center**  
  
 Sites created after the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] integration will not have the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] content types enabled.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  If you have **not** previously configured content types for a library, first enable management of content types, then enable the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] content types. See the procedures on enabling content type management in a single document library.
