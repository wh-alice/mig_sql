# Lesson 3: Accessing the Web Service
After you add a reference for the Report Server Web service to your project, the next step is to create an instance of the Web service's proxy class. You can then access the methods of the Web service by calling the methods in the proxy class. When your application calls these methods, the proxy class code generated by [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../a9retired/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] handles the communications between your application and the Web service.  
  
First, you will create an instance of the Web service's proxy class, <xref:ReportService2010.ReportingService2010>. Next, you will make a call to the Web service's ReportingService2010.getproperties method using the proxy class [ReportingService2010.GetProperties Method (String, Property())](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt231208.aspx#M:ReportService2010.ReportingService2010.GetProperties(System.String,ReportService2010.Property[])). You will use the call to retrieve the name and description of one of the sample reports, Company Sales.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> When accessing a Web service running on [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../a9notintoc/includes/ssexpress-md.md)] with Advanced Services, you must append "$SQLExpress" to the "ReportServer" path. For example:  
>   
> `http://<Server Name>/reportserver$sqlexpress/reportservice2010.asmx"`  
  
### To access the Web service  
  
1.  You must first add the namespace to the Program.cs file (Module1.vb in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../a9retired/includes/vbprvb-md.md)]) by adding a **using** (**Imports** in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../a9retired/includes/vbprvb-md.md)]) directive to the code file. If you use this directive, you do not need to fully qualify the types in the namespace.  
  
2.  To do this, add the following code to the beginning of your code file:  
  
    ```vb#  
    Imports System  
    Imports GetPropertiesSample.ReportService2010  
    ```  
  
    ```c#  
    using System;  
    using GetPropertiesSample.ReportService2010;  
    ```  
  
3.  Once you have entered the namespace directive to your code file, enter the following code in the Main method of your console application. Make sure to change the name of your server when setting the **Url** property of the web service instance:  
  
    ```vb#  
    Sub Main()  
       Dim rs As New ReportingService2010  
       rs.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials  
       rs.Url = "http://<Server Name>/reportserver/reportservice2010.asmx"  
  
       Dim name As New [Property]  
       name.Name = "Name"  
  
       Dim description As New [Property]  
       description.Name = "Description"  
  
       Dim properties(1) As [Property]  
       properties(0) = name  
       properties(1) = description  
  
       Try  
          Dim returnProperties As [Property]() = rs.GetProperties( _  
             "/AdventureWorks 2012 Sample Reports/Company Sales 2012", properties)  
  
          Dim p As [Property]  
          For Each p In returnProperties  
              Console.WriteLine((p.Name + ": " + p.Value))  
          Next p  
  
       Catch e As Exception  
          Console.WriteLine(e.Message)  
       End Try  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```c#  
    static void Main(string[] args)  
    {  
       ReportingService2010 rs = new ReportingService2010();  
       rs.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;  
       rs.Url = "http://<Server Name>/reportserver/reportservice2010.asmx";  
  
       Property name = new Property();  
       name.Name = "Name";  
  
       Property description = new Property();  
       description.Name = "Description";  
  
       Property[] properties = new Property[2];  
       properties[0] = name;  
       properties[1] = description;  
  
       try  
       {  
          Property[] returnProperties = rs.GetProperties(  
          "/AdventureWorks 2012 Sample Reports/Company Sales 2012",properties);  
  
          foreach (Property p in returnProperties)  
          {  
             Console.WriteLine(p.Name + ": " + p.Value);  
          }  
       }  
  
       catch (Exception e)  
       {  
          Console.WriteLine(e.Message);  
       }  
    }  
    ```  
  
4.  Save the solution.  
  
The walkthrough sample code uses the ReportingService2010.getproperties method of the Web service to retrieve properties of the sample report, Company Sales 2012 [ReportingService2010.GetProperties Method (String, Property())](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt231208.aspx#M:ReportService2010.ReportingService2010.GetProperties(System.String,ReportService2010.Property[])). The  method takes two arguments: the name of the report for which you want to retrieve property information and an array of **Property[]** objects that contains the names of properties whose values you want to retrieve. The method also returns an array of **Property[]** objects that contains the names and values of the properties specified in the properties argument.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> If you supply an empty **Property[]** array for the properties argument, all available properties are returned.  
  
In the previous sample, the code uses the ReportingService2010.getproperties method to return the name and description of the sample report, Company Sales 2012. The code then uses a **foreach** loop to write the properties and values to the console.
