# Overview of PowerShell Cmdlets for Always On Availability Groups (SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] provides a set of PowerShell cmdlets in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] that enable you to deploy, manage, and monitor availability groups, availability replicas, and availability databases.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  A PowerShell cmdlet can complete by successfully initiating an action. This does not indicate that the intended work, such as the fail over of an availability group, has completed. When scripting a sequence of actions, you might have to check the status of actions, and wait for them to complete.  
  
 This topic introduces the cmdlets for the following sets of tasks:  
  
-   [Configuring a server instance for Always On Availability Groups](#ConfiguringServerInstance)  
  
-   [Backing up and restoring databases and transaction logs](#BnRcmdlets)  
  
-   [Creating and managing an availability group](#DeployManageAGs)  
  
-   [Creating and managing an availability group listener](#AGlisteners)  
  
-   [Creating and managing an availability replica](#DeployManageARs)  
  
-   [Adding and managing an availability database](#DeployManageDbs)  
  
-   [Monitoring availability group health](#MonitorTblshtAGs)  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For a list of topics in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Books Online that describe how to use cmdlets to perform [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] tasks, see the "Related Tasks" section of [Overview of Always On Availability Groups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/overview-of-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server.md).
