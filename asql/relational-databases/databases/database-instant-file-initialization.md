# Database Instant File Initialization
  Data and log files are initialized to overwrite any existing data left on the disk from previously deleted files. Data and log files are first initialized by filling the files with zeros when you perform one of the following operations:  
  
-   Create a database.  
  
-   Add files, log or data, to an existing database.  
  
-   Increase the size of an existing file (including autogrow operations).  
  
-   Restore a database or filegroup.  
  
 File initialization causes these operations to take longer. However, when data is written to the files for the first time, the operating system does not have to fill the files with zeros.  
  
## Instant File Initialization  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], data files can be initialized instantaneously. This allows for fast execution of the previously mentioned file operations. Instant file initialization reclaims used disk space without filling that space with zeros. Instead, disk content is overwritten as new data is written to the files. Log files cannot be initialized instantaneously.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Instant file initialization is available only on [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[winxppro](../../relational-databases/databases/includes/winxppro-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[winxpsvr](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/winxpsvr-md.md)] or later versions.  
  
 Instant file initialization is only available if the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (MSSQLSERVER) service account has been granted SE_MANAGE_VOLUME_NAME. Members of the Windows Administrator group have this right and can grant it to other users by adding them to the **Perform Volume Maintenance Tasks** security policy. For more information about assigning user rights, see the Windows documentation.  
  
 Instant file initialization is not available when TDE is enabled.  
  
 To grant an account the `Perform volume maintenance tasks` permission:  
  
1.  On the computer where the backup file will be created, open the **Local Security Policy** application (`secpol.msc`).  
  
2.  In the left pane, expand **Local Policies**, and then click **User Rights Assignment**.  
  
3.  In the right pane, double-click **Perform volume maintenance tasks**.  
  
4.  Click **Add User or Group** and add any user accounts that are used for backups.  
  
5.  Click **Apply**, and then close all **Local Security Policy** dialog boxes.  
  
### Security Considerations  
 Because the deleted disk content is overwritten only as new data is written to the files, the deleted content might be accessed by an unauthorized principal. While the database file is attached to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], this information disclosure threat is reduced by the discretionary access control list (DACL) on the file. This DACL allows file access only to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service account and the local administrator. However, when the file is detached, it may be accessed by a user or service that does not have SE_MANAGE_VOLUME_NAME. A similar threat exists when the database is backed up. The deleted content can become available to an unauthorized user or service if the backup file is not protected with an appropriate DACL.  
  
 If the potential for disclosing deleted content is a concern, you should do one or both of the following:  
  
-   Always make sure that any detached data files and backup files have restrictive DACLs.  
  
-   Disable instant file initialization for the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by revoking SE_MANAGE_VOLUME_NAME from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service account.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Disabling instant file initialization only affects files that are created or increased in size after the user right is revoked.
