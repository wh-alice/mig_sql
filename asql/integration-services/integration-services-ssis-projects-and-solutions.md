# Integration Services (SSIS) Projects and Solutions
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] for the development of [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages.  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages reside in projects. To create and work with [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] projects, you must install the [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] environment. For more information, see [Install Integration Services](../integration-services/install/windows/install-integration-services.md).  
  
 When you create a new [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], the **New Project** dialog box includes an **Integration Services Project** template. This project template creates a new project that contains a single package.  
  
## Projects and solutions  
 Projects are stored in solutions. You can create a solution first and then add an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project to the solution. If no solution exists, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] automatically creates one for you when you first create the project. A solution can contain multiple projects of different types.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  By default, when you create a new project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)], the solution is not shown in **Solution Explorer** pane. To change this default behavior, on the **Tools** menus, click **Options**. In the **Options** dialog box, expand **Projects and Solutions**, and then click **General**. On the **General** page, select **Always show solution**.  

## Solutions contain projects  
 A solution is a container that groups and manages the projects that you use when you develop end-to-end business solutions. A solution lets you handle multiple projects as one unit and to bring together one or more related projects that contribute to a business solution.  
  
 Solutions can include different types of projects. If you want to use [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer to create an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] package, you work in an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project in a solution provided by [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 When you create a new solution, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] adds a Solution folder to Solution Explorer, and creates files that have the extensions, .sln and .suo:  
  
-   The *.sln file contains information about the solution configuration and lists the projects in the solution.  
  
-   The *.suo file contains information about your preferences for working with the solution.  
  
 While [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] automatically creates a solution when you create a new project, you can also create a blank solution, and then add projects later.  
   
## Integration Services projects contain packages  
 A project is a container in which you develop [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project stores and groups the files that are related to the package. For example, a project includes the files that are required to create a specific extract, transfer, and load (ETL) solution.  
  
 Before you create an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project, you should become familiar with the basic contents of this kind of project. After you understand what a project contains, you can begin creating and working with an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project.  
  
## Folders in Integration Services projects  
 The following diagram shows the folders in an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 ![Folders in an Integration Services project](../integration-services/media/solutionexplorer.gif "Folders in an Integration Services project")  
  
 The following table describes the folders that appear in an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project.  
  
|Folder|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssIS](../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Packages|Contains packages. For more information, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Packages](../integration-services/integration-services-ssis-packages.md).|  
|Miscellaneous|Contains files other than package files.|  
  
## Files in Integration Services projects  
 When you add a new or an existing [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project to a solution, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] creates project files that have the extensions .dtproj and .dtproj.user and .database.  
  
-   The *.dtproj file contains information about project configurations and items such as packages.  
  
-   The *.dtproj.user file contains information about your preferences for working with the project.  
  
-   The *.database file contains information that [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] requires to open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project.  
  
## Version targeting in Integration Services projects  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], you can create, maintain, and run packages that target SQL Server 2016, SQL Server 2014, or SQL Server 2012.  
  
 In Solution Explorer, right-click on an Integration Services project and select **Properties** to open the property pages for the project. On the **General** tab of **Configuration Properties**, select the **TargetServerVersion** property,  and then choose SQL Server 2016, SQL Server 2014, or SQL Server 2012.

## Create a new Integration Services project  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.  
  
3.  In the **New Project** dialog box, in the **Templates** pane, select the **Integration Services Project** template.  
  
     The **Integration Services Project** template creates an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains a single, empty package.  
  
4.  (Optional) Edit the project name and the location.  
  
     The solution name is automatically updated to match the project name.  
  
5.  To create a separate folder for the solution file, select **Create directory for solution**. This is the default option.  
  
6.  If source control software is installed on the computer, select **Add to source control**  to associate the project with source control.  
  
7.  If the source control software is [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual SourceSafe, the **Visual SourceSafe Login** dialog box opens. In **Visual SourceSafe Login**, provide a user name, a password, and the name of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual SourceSafe database. Click **Browse** to locate the database.  
  
    > **NOTE:** To view and change the selected source control plug-in and to configure the source control environment, click **Options** on the **Tools** menu, and then expand the **Source Control** node.  
  
8.  Click **OK** to add the solution to **Solution Explorer** and add the project to the solution.  
  
## Choose the target version of a project and its packages  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click on an Integration Services project and select **Properties** to open the property pages for the project.  
  
2.  On the **General** tab of **Configuration Properties**, select the **TargetServerVersion** property,  and then choose SQL Server 2016, SQL Server 2014, or SQL Server 2012.  
  
     ![TargetServerVersion property in project properties dialog box](../a9retired/media/targetserverversion2.png "TargetServerVersion property in project properties dialog box")  
  
 You can create, maintain, and run packages that target SQL Server 2016, SQL Server 2014, or SQL Server 2012.  

## Import an existing project with the Import Project Wizard
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../a9retired/includes/vsprvs-md.md)], click **New** > **Project** on the **File** menu.  
  
2.  In the **Installed Templates** area of the **New Project** window, expand **Business Intelligence**, and click **Integration Services**.  
  
3.  Select **Integration Services Import Project Wizard** from the project types list.  
  
4.  Type a name for the new project to be created in the **Name** text box.  
  
5.  Type the path or location for the project in the **Location** text box, or click **Browse** to select one.  
  
6.  Type a name for the solution in the **Solution name** text box.  
  
7.  Click **OK** to launch the **Integration Services Import Project Wizard** dialog box.  
  
8.  Click **Next** to switch to the **Select Source** page.  
  
9. If you are importing from an **.ispac** file, type the path including file name in the **Path** text box. Click **Browse** to navigate to the folder where you want the solution to be stored and type file name in the **File name** text box, and click **Open**.  
  
     If you are importing from an **Integration Services Catalog**, type the database instance name in the **Server name** text box or click **Browse** and select the database instance that contains the catalog.  
  
     Click **Browse** next to **Path** text box, expand folder in the catalog, select the project you want to import, and click **OK**.  
  
     Click **Next** to switch to the **Review** page.  
  
10. Review the information and click **Import** to create a project based on the existing project you selected.  
  
11. Optional: click **Save Report** to save the results to a file  
  
12. Click **Close** to close the **Integration Services Import Project Wizard** dialog box.  

## Add a project to a solution 
 When you add a project, you can have [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] create a new, blank project, or you can add a project that you have already created for a different solution. You can only add a project to an existing solution when the solution is visible in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
### Add a new project to a solution  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the solution to which you want to add a new [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project, and do one of the following:  
  
    -   Right-click the solution, click **Add**, and then click **New Project**.  
  
    -   On the **File** menu, point to **Add**, and then click **New Project**.  
  
2.  In the **Add New Project** dialog box, click **Integration Services Project** in the **Templates** pane.  
  
3.  Optionally, edit the project name and location.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
### Add an existing project to a solution  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the solution to which you want to add an existing [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project, and do one of the following:  
  
    -   Right-click the solution, point to **Add**, and then click **Existing Project**.  
  
    -   On the **File** menu, click **Add**, and then click **Existing Project**.  
  
2.  In the **Add Existing Project** dialog box, browse to locate the project you want to add, and then click **Open**.  
  
3.  The project is added to the solution folder in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
## Remove a project from a solution
 You can only remove a project from a solution when the solution is visible in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. After the solution is visible, you can remove all except one project. As soon as only one project remains, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] no longer displays the solution folder and you cannot remove the last project.  
   
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the solution from which you want to remove an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the project, and then click **Unload Project**.  
  
3.  Click **OK** to confirm the removal.  

## Add an item to a project  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the solution that contains the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project to which you want to add an item.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the project, point to **Add**, and do one of the following:  
  
    -   Click **New Item**, and then select a template from the **Templates** pane in the **Add New Item** dialog box.  
  
    -   Click **Existing Item**, browse in the **Add Existing Item** dialog box to locate the item you want to add to the project, and then click **Add**.  
  
3.  The new item appears in the appropriate folder in Solution Explorer.  

## Copy project items  
You can copy objects within an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project or between [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] projects. You can also copy objects between the other types of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] projects, [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. To copy between projects, the project must be part of the same [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] solution.

1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project or solution that you want to work with.  
  
2.  Expand the project and item folder to copy from.  
  
3.  Right-click the item and click **Copy**.  
  
4.  Right-click the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project to copy to and click **Paste**.  
  
     The items are automatically copied to the correct folder. If you copy items to the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that are not packages, the items are copied to the **Miscellaneous** folder.
