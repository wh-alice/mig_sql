# STBuffer (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../integration-services/system/stored-procedures/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns a geography object that represents the union of all points whose distance from a **geography** instance is less than or equal to a specified value.  
  
 This geography data type method supports **FullGlobe** instances or spatial instances that are larger than a hemisphere.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STBuffer ( distance )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *distance*  
 Is a value of type **float** (**double** in the .NET Framework) specifying the distance from the **geography** instance around which to calculate the buffer.  
  
 The maximum distance of the buffer cannot exceed 0.999 \* *π* * minorAxis \* minorAxis / majorAxis (~0.999 \* 1/2 Earth’s circumference) or the full globe.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **geography**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlGeography**  
  
## Remarks  
 STBuffer() calculates a buffer in the same manner as [BufferWithTolerance](../../../t-sql/spatial/geography/bufferwithtolerance-geography-data-type.md), specifying *tolerance* = abs(distance) \* .001 and *relative* = **false**.  
  
 A negative buffer removes all points within the given distance of the boundary of the **geography** instance.  
  
 `STBuffer()` will return a **FullGlobe** instance in certain cases; for example, `STBuffer()` returns a **FullGlobe** instance when the buffer distance is greater than the distance from the equator to the poles. A buffer cannot exceed the full globe.  
  
 This method will throw an **ArgumentException** in **FullGlobe** instances where the distance of the buffer exceeds the following limitation:  
  
 0.999 \* *π* * minorAxis \* minorAxis / majorAxis (~0.999 \* 1/2 Earth’s circumference)  
  
 The maximum distance limit allows the construction of the buffer to be as flexible as possible.  
  
 The error between the theorectical and computed buffer is max(tolerance, extents * 1.E-7) where tolerance = distance \* .001. For more information on extents, see [geography Data Type Method Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/028e6137-7128-4c74-90a7-f7bdd2d79f5e).  
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates a `LineString``geography` instance. It then uses `STBuffer()` to return the region within 1 meter of the instance.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656)', 4326);  
SELECT @g.STBuffer(1).ToString();  
```
