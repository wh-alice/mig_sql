# Avoid Conflicts with Database Operations in FILESTREAM Applications
  Applications that use SqlOpenFilestream() to open Win32 file handles for reading or writing FILESTREAM BLOB data can encounter conflict errors with [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that are managed in a common transaction. This includes [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] or MARS queries that take a long time to finish execution. Applications must be carefully designed to help avoid these types of conflicts.  
  
 When [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] or applications try to open FILESTREAM BLOBs, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] checks the associated transaction context. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] allows or denies the request based on whether the open operation is working with DDL statements, DML statements, retrieving data, or managing transactions. The following table shows how the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] determines whether a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement will be allowed or denied based on the type of files that are open in the transaction.  
  
|Transact-SQL statements|Opened for read|Opened for write|  
|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|  
|DDL statements that work with database metadata, such as CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, DROP TABLE, and ALTER TABLE.|Allowed|Are blocked and fail with a time-out.|  
|DML statements that work with the data that is stored in the database, such as UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT.|Allowed|Denied|  
|SELECT|Allowed|Allowed|  
|COMMIT TRANSACTION|Denied*|Denied*.|  
|SAVE TRANSACTION|Denied*|Denied*|  
|ROLLBACK|Allowed*|Allowed*|  
  
 \* The transaction is canceled, and open handles for the transaction context are invalidated. The application must close all open handles.  
  
## Examples  
 The following examples show how [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements and FILESTREAM Win32 access can cause conflicts.  
  
### A. Opening a FILESTREAM BLOB for write access  
 The following example shows the effect of opening a file for write access only.  
  
```  
dstHandle =  OpenSqlFilestream(dstFilePath, Write, 0,  
    transactionToken, cbTransactionToken, 0);  
  
//Write some date to the FILESTREAM BLOB.  
WriteFile(dstHandle, updateData, …);  
  
//DDL statements will be denied.  
//DML statements will be denied.  
//SELECT statements will be allowed. The FILESTREAM BLOB is  
//returned without the modifications that are made by  
//WriteFile(dstHandle, updateData, …).  
CloseHandle(dstHandle);  
  
//DDL statements will be allowed.  
//DML statements will be allowed.  
//SELECT statements will be allowed. The FILESTREAM BLOB  
//is returned with the updateData applied.  
```  
  
### B. Opening a FILESTREAM BLOB for read access  
 The following example shows the effect of opening a file for read access only.  
  
```  
dstHandle =  OpenSqlFilestream(dstFilePath, Read, 0,  
    transactionToken, cbTransactionToken, 0);  
//DDL statements will be denied.  
//DML statements will be allowed. Any changes that are  
//made to the FILESTREAM BLOB will not be returned until  
//the dstHandle is closed.  
//SELECT statements will be allowed.  
CloseHandle(dstHandle);  
  
//DDL statements will be allowed.  
//DML statements will be allowed.  
//SELECT statements will be allowed.  
```  
  
### C. Opening and closing multiple FILESTREAM BLOB files  
 If multiple files are open, the most restrictive rule is used. The following example opens two files. The first file is opened for read and the second for write. DML statements will be denied until the second file is opened.  
  
```  
dstHandle =  OpenSqlFilestream(dstFilePath, Read, 0,  
    transactionToken, cbTransactionToken, 0);  
//DDL statements will be denied.  
//DML statements will be allowed.  
//SELECT statements will be allowed.  
  
dstHandle1 =  OpenSqlFilestream(dstFilePath1, Write, 0,  
    transactionToken, cbTransactionToken, 0);  
  
//DDL statements will be denied.  
//DML statements will be denied.  
//SELECT statements will be allowed.  
  
//Close the read handle. The write handle is still open.  
CloseHandle(dstHandle);  
//DML statements are still denied because the write handle is open.  
  
//DDL statements will be denied.  
//DML statements will be denied.  
//SELECT statements will be allowed.  
  
CloseHandle(dstHandle1);  
//DDL statements will be allowed.  
//DML statements will be allowed.  
//SELECT statements will be allowed.  
```  
  
### D. Failing to close a cursor  
 The following example shows how a statement cursor that is not closed can prevent `OpenSqlFilestream()` from opening the BLOB for write access.  
  
```  
TCHAR *sqlDBQuery =  
TEXT("SELECT GET_FILESTREAM_TRANSACTION_CONTEXT(),")  
TEXT("Chart.PathName() FROM Archive.dbo.Records");  
  
//Execute a long-running Transact-SQL statement. Do not allow  
//the statement to complete before trying to  
//open the file.  
  
SQLExecDirect(hstmt, sqlDBQuery, SQL_NTS);  
  
//Before you call OpenSqlFilestream() any open files  
//that the Cursor the Transact-SQL statement is using  
// must be closed. In this example,  
//SQLCloseCursor(hstmt) is not called so that  
//the transaction will indicate that there is a file  
//open for reading. This will cause the call to  
//OpenSqlFilestream() to fail because the file is  
//still open.  
  
HANDLE srcHandle =  OpenSqlFilestream(srcFilePath,  
     Write, 0,  transactionToken,  cbTransactionToken,  0);  
  
//srcHandle will == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE because the  
//cursor is still open.  
```
