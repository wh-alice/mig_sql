# Post-Save Notifications Dialog Box (Visual Database Tools)
This dialog box appears when errors are encountered while trying to save changes to a table. This dialog box lists the objects that were successfully saved in the database, the objects that were not saved, and the errors that were encountered.  
  
## Options  
**Save Text File**  
Display the **Save As** dialog box, prompting you for a location in which to save a text file listing the error information. This file provides a record of the database changes that were successfully saved as well as the changes that could not be saved due to errors.
