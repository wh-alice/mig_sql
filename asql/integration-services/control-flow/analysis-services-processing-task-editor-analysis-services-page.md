# Analysis Services Processing Task Editor (Analysis Services Page)
  Use the **Analysis Services** page of the **Analysis Services Processing Task Editor** dialog box to specify an Analysis Services connection manager, select the analytic objects to process, and set processing and error handling options.  
  
 When processing tabular models, keep the following in mind:  
  
1.  You cannot perform impact analysis on tabular models.  
  
2.  Some processing options for tabular mode are not exposed, such as Process Defrag and Process Recalc. You can perform these functions by using the Execute DDL task.  
  
3.  Some processing options provided, such as process indexes, are not appropriate for tabular models and should not be used.  
  
4.  Batch settings are ignored for tabular models.  
  
 To learn about this task, see [Analysis Services Processing Task](../../integration-services/control-flow/analysis-services-processing-task.md).
