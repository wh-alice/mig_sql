# Execute Package Utility (DtExecUI) UI Reference
  Use the **Execute Package Utility** to run [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages. The utility runs packages that are stored in one of three locations: [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database, the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Package Store, and the file system. This user interface, which can be opened from [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or by typing **dtexecui** at a command prompt, is an alternative to running packages by using the **DTExec** command prompt tool.  
  
 Packages execute in the same process as the **dtexecui.exe** utility. Because this utility is a 32-bit tool, packages run by using **dtexecui.exe** in a 64-bit environment run in Windows on Win32 (WOW). When developing and testing commands by using the dtexecui.exe utility on a 64-bit computer, you should test the commands in 64-bit mode by using the 64-bit version of **dtexec.exe** before deploying or scheduling the commands on a production server.  
  
 The **Execute Package Utility** is a graphical user interface for the **DTExec** command prompt tool. The user interface makes it easy to configure options and it automatically assembles the command line that is passed to the **DTExec** command prompt tool when you run the package from the specified options.  
  
 The **Execute Package Utility** can also be used to assemble command lines that you use when running **DTExec** directly.  
  
### To open Execute Package Utility in SQL Server Management Studio  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], on the **View** menu, click **Object Explorer**.  
  
2.  In Object Explorer, click **Connect**, and then click **Integration Services**.  
  
3.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, enter the server name in the **Server name** list, and then click **Connect**.  
  
4.  Expand the **Stored Package**s folder and subfolders, right-click the package you want to run, and then click **Run Package**.  
  
### To open the Execute Package Utility at the Command Prompt  
  
-   In a command prompt window, run **dtexecui**.  
  
 The following sections describe pages of the **Execute Package Utility** dialog box.  
  
## General Page  
 Use the **General** page of the **Execute Package Utility** dialog box to specify a package name and location.  
  
 The Execute Package utility (dtexecui.exe) always runs a package on the local computer, even if the package is saved on a remote server. If the remote package uses configuration files that also are saved on the remote server, then the Execute Package utility may not locate the configurations and the package fails. To avoid this problem, the configurations must be referenced by using a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share name like \\\myserver\myfile.  
  
### Static Options  
 **Package source**  
 Specify the location of the package to run, using the following options:  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Value|Description|  
|**SQL Server**|Select this option when the package resides in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Specify an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and provide a user name and password for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication. Each user name and password adds the **/USER** *username* and **/PASSWORD** *password* options to the command prompt.|  
|**File system**|Select this option when the package resides in the file system.|  
|**SSIS Package Store**|Select this option when the package resides in the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Package Store.|  
  
 Each of these selections has the following set of options.  
  
 **Execute**  
 Click to run the package.  
  
 **Close**  
 Click to close the **Execute Package Utility** dialog box.  
  
### Dynamic Options  
  
#### Package Source = SQL Server  
 **Server**  
 Type the name of the server where the package resides, or select a server from the list.  
  
 **Log on to the server**  
 Specify whether the package should use Windows Authentication or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Windows Authentication is recommended for better security. With Windows Authentication you do not have to specify a user name and password.  
  
 **Use Windows Authentication**  
 Select this option to use Windows Authentication and log on using a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows user account.  
  
 **Use SQL Server Authentication**  
 Select this option to use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication. When a user connects with a specified login name and password from a non-trusted connection, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] performs the authentication by checking to see if a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login account has been set up and if the specified password matches the one previously recorded. If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cannot find the login account, authentication fails, and the user receives an error message.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When possible, use Windows Authentication.  
  
 **Package**  
 Type the name of the package, or click the ellipsis button **(…)** to locate a package using the **Select an SSIS Package** dialog box.

 **Server**  
 Type the name of the computer where the package resides, or select a computer from the list.  
  
 **Log on to the server**  
 Specify whether the package should use Microsoft Windows Authentication to connect to the package source. Windows Authentication is recommended for better security. With Windows Authentication you do not have to specify a user name and password.  
  
 **Use Windows Authentication**  
 Select this option to use Windows Authentication and log on using a Microsoft Windows user account.  
  
 **Use SQL Server Authentication**  
 This option is not available when you run a package stored in the **SSIS Package Store**.
