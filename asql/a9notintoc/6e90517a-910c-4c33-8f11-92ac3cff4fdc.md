# Task 6: Verify that the Domain-Based Attribute is Created using Master Data Manager
In this task, you verify that the **State** entity is created in **MDS** and the **State** attribute of the **Supplier** entity is a domain-based attribute that depends on the **State** entity by using **Master Data Manager**.  
  
1.  Switch to the **Master Data Manger** web application.  
  
2.  Click **SQL Server 2012 Master Data Services** at the top to get to the home page.  
  
3.  Ensure that **Suppliers** model is selected and click **Explorer**. You could refresh the page if you already had **Explorer** open.  
  
4.  Hover your mouse over **Entities** on the menu bar and notice that now there are two entities: **Supplier** and **State**.

5.  Click **State** if the entity is not open already.  
  
6.  Select **GA** from the list.  
  
7.  In the **Details** pane to the right, change the **Name** to **Georgia** in the **right pane**, and click **OK**.  
  
8.  Repeat the previous steps for other states.
