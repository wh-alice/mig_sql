# sysmail_sentitems (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Contains one row for each message sent by Database Mail. Use **sysmail_sentitems** when you want to see which messages were successfully sent.  
  
 To see all messages processed by Database Mail, use [sysmail_allitems &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sysmail-allitems-transact-sql.md). To see only messages with the failed status, use [sysmail_faileditems &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sysmail-faileditems-transact-sql.md). To see only unsent or retrying messages, use [sysmail_unsentitems &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sysmail-unsentitems-transact-sql.md). To see e-mail attachments, use [sysmail_mailattachments &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sysmail-mailattachments-transact-sql.md).

## Remarks  
 When troubleshooting Database Mail, this view may help you identify the nature of the problem, by showing you the attributes of the messages that were successfully sent. Database Mail marks messages as sent when they are successfully submitted to an SMTP mail server. Normally e-mail is received in a few minutes, but the e-mail can be delayed because of problems with the SMTP server. Database Mail marks the message as sent when it is accepted by the SMTP mail server. E-mail errors that occur on the SMTP mail server, such as an undeliverable recipient e-mail address, are not returned to Database Mail. Those e-mails are recorded as sent, even though they are not delivered. Troubleshoot that type of error on the SMTP server. Also, the SMTP mail server may send an undeliverable message notification to the reply e-mail address for a Database Mail account.  
  
## Permissions  
 Granted to **sysadmin** fixed server role and **databasemailuserrole** database role. When executed by a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role, this view shows all sent messages. All other users only see the messages that they sent.
