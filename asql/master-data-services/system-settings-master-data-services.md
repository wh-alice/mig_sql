# System Settings (Master Data Services)
  For all web applications and web services associated with a [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database, you can configure system settings.  
  
 Many of these settings can be configured in [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../a9retired/includes/ssmdscfgmgr-md.md)] on the **Database** page. Others can be configured in the System Settings table (mdm.tblSystemSetting) in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database.  
  
 The settings can be grouped in the following categories:  
  
-   [General Settings](#General)  
  
-   [Version Management Settings](#Versions)  
  
-   [Staging Settings](#Staging)  
  
-   [Explorer Settings](#Explorer)  
  
-   [Add-in for Excel Settings](#xls)  
  
-   [Business Rule Settings](#BusinessRules)  
  
-   [Notification Settings](#Notifications)  
  
-   [Security Settings](#Security)  
  
-   [Not Used](#NotUsed)
