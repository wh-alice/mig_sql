# transform noise words Server Configuration Option
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Use the **transform noise words** server configuration option to suppress an error message if noise words, that is [stopwords](../../../relational-databases/search/configure-and-manage-stopwords-and-stoplists-for-full-text-search.md), cause a Boolean operation on a full-text query to return zero rows. This option is useful for full-text queries that use the CONTAINS predicate in which Boolean operations or NEAR operations include noise words. The possible values are described in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|0|Noise words (or stopwords) are not transformed. When a full-text query contains noise words, the query returns zero rows, and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] raises a warning. This is the default behavior.<br /><br /> Note: The warning is a run-time warning. Therefore, if the full-text clause in the query is not executed, the warning is not raised. For a local query, only one warning is raised, even when there are multiple full-text query clauses. For a remote query, the linked server might not relay the error; therefore, the warning might not be raised.|  
|1|Noise words (or stopwords) are transformed. They are ignored, and the rest of the query is evaluated.<br /><br /> If noise words are specified in a proximity term, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] removes them. For example, the noise word `is` is removed from `CONTAINS(<column_name>, 'NEAR (hello,is,goodbye)')`, transforming the search query into `CONTAINS(<column_name>, 'NEAR(hello,goodbye)')`. Notice that `CONTAINS(<column_name>, 'NEAR(hello,is)')` would be transformed into simply `CONTAINS(<column_name>, hello)` because there is only one valid search term.|  
  
## Effects of the transform noise words Setting  
 This section illustrates the behavior of queries containing a noise word, "`the`", under the alternate settings of **transform noise words**.  The sample full-text query strings are assumed to be run against a table row containing the following data: `[1, "The black cat"]`.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  All such scenarios can generate a noise word warning.  
  
-   With transform noise words set to 0:  
  
    |Query string|Result|  
    |------------------|------------|  
    |"`cat`" AND "`the`"|No results (The behavior is the same for "`the`" AND "`cat`".)|  
    |"`cat`" NEAR "`the`"|No results (The behavior is the same for "`the`" NEAR "`cat`".)|  
    |"`the`" AND NOT "`black`"|No results|  
    |"`black`" AND NOT "`the`"|No results|  
  
-   With transform noise words set to 1:  
  
    |Query string|Result|  
    |------------------|------------|  
    |"`cat`" AND "`the`"|Hit for row with ID 1|  
    |"`cat`" NEAR "`the`"|Hit for row with ID 1|  
    |"`the`" AND NOT "`black`"|No results|  
    |"`black`" AND NOT "`the`"|Hit for row with ID 1|  
  
## Example  
 The following example sets **transform noise words** to `1`.  
  
```  
sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;  
RECONFIGURE;  
GO  
sp_configure 'transform noise words', 1;  
RECONFIGURE;  
GO  
```
