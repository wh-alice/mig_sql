# Report Builder Functions - Count Function
  Returns a count of non-null values specified by the expression, evaluated in the context of the given scope.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../reporting-services/report-builder/includes/ssrbrddup-md.md)]  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Count(expression, scope, recursive)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *expression*  
 (**Variant** or **Binary**) The expression on which to perform the aggregation, for example, `=Fields!FieldName.Value`.  
  
 *scope*  
 (**String**) The name of a dataset, group, or data region that contains the report items to which to apply the aggregate function. If *scope* is not specified, the current scope is used.  
  
 *recursive*  
 (**Enumerated Type**) Optional. **Simple** (default) or **RdlRecursive**. Specifies whether to perform the aggregation recursively.  
  
## Return Type  
 Returns an **Integer**.  
  
## Remarks  
 The value of *scope* must be a string constant and cannot be an expression. For outer aggregates or aggregates that do not specify other aggregates, *scope* must refer to the current scope or a containing scope. For aggregates of aggregates, nested aggregates can specify a child scope.  
  
 *Expression* can contain calls to nested aggregate functions with the following exceptions and conditions:  
  
-   *Scope* for nested aggregates must be the same as, or contained by, the scope of the outer aggregate. For all distinct scopes in the expression, one scope must be in a child relationship to all other scopes.  
  
-   *Scope* for nested aggregates cannot be the name of a dataset.  
  
-   *Expression* must not contain **First**, **Last**, **Previous**, or **RunningValue** functions.  
  
-   *Expression* must not contain nested aggregates that specify *recursive*.

 Example  
  
## Description  
 The following code example shows an expression that calculates the number of non-null values of `Size` for the default scope and for a parent group scope. The expression is added to a cell in a row that belongs to the child group `GroupbySubcategory`. The parent group is `GroupbyCategory`. The expression displays the results for `GroupbySubcategory` (the default scope) and then for `GroupbyCategory` (the parent group scope).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Expressions should not contain actual carriage returns and line breaks; these are included in the example to support documentation renderers. If you copy the following example, remove carriage returns from each line.  
  
## Code  
  
```  
="Count (Subcategory): " & Count(Fields!Size.Value) &   
"Count (Category): " & Count(Fields!Size.Value,"GroupbyCategory")  
```
