# Script with the rs.exe Utility and the Web Service
  Developers and report server administrators can perform operations on a report server through the use of the **rs** utility (RS.exe). Using this utility, you can programmatically administer a report server using scripts written with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/vbprvb-md.md)].  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] scripts can be used to run any of the Report Server Web service operations. Scripting can be used to copy security to multiple reports on a server, to add and delete items, to copy report server items from one server to another and more. For more information about the scripting environment, see [Run a Reporting Services Script File](../../reporting-services/tools/run-a-reporting-services-script-file.md). Script files take a certain format and are written in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] .NET. For more information, see [Format a Reporting Services Script File](../../reporting-services/tools/format-a-reporting-services-script-file.md).  
  
 For script samples, see the following:
