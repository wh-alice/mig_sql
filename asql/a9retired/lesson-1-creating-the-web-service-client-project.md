# Lesson 1: Creating the Web Service Client Project
For this walkthrough, you will create a simple console application that accesses the Report Server Web service. This walkthrough assumes you are developing in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../a9retired/includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
### To create a console application  
  
1.  On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project** to open the **New Project** dialog box.  
  
2.  In the left pane, under **Installed Templates**, click either **Visual Basic** or the **Visual C#** node, and select a category of project types from the expanded list.  
  
3.  Choose the **Console Application** project type.  
  
4.  In the **Name** box, enter a name for your project. Type the name **GetPropertiesSample**.  
  
5.  In the **Location** box, enter the path where you want to save your project, or click **Browse** to navigate to the folder.  
  
6.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../a9notintoc/includes/clickok-md.md)] A collapsed view of your project appears in Solution Explorer.  
  
    In Solution Explorer, expand the project node. A file with the default name of Program.cs (Module1.vb for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../a9retired/includes/vbprvb-md.md)]) has been added to your project.
