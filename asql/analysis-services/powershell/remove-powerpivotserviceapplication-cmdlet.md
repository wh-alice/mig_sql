# Remove-PowerPivotServiceApplication cmdlet
  Deletes a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] service application.  
  
 **Applies To:** SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Remove-PowerPivotServiceApplication [-Identity <SPGeminiServiceApplicationPipeBind>] [-DeleteAll <switch>] [-RemoveData <switch>] [-Confirm <switch>] [<CommonParameters>]  
```  
  
## Description  
 The Remove-PowerPivotServiceApplication cmdlet deletes a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] service application from the farm. Use DeleteAll to delete all service applications at once, or use the Identity parameter to remove a single instance. To get instance information, run Get-PowerPivotServiceApplication to return all instances in the farm.  
  
 Use the RemoveData parameter to optionally remove service application databases and cached files. [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks remain in content libraries, but are no longer functional once the service application is removed.  
  
## Parameters  
  
### -Identity \<SPGeminiServiceApplicationPipeBind>  
 Specifies the GUID of a single [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] service application in the farm. You must specify the GUID if you want to remove just one application, leaving other service applications intact.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Required?|false|  
|Position?|0|  
|Default value||  
|Accept pipeline input?|true|  
|Accept wildcard characters?|false|  
  
### -Confirm \<switch>  
 Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command. This value is enabled by default. To bypass the confirmation response in a command, specify Confirm:$false on the command.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Required?|false|  
|Position?|named|  
|Default value||  
|Accept pipeline input?|false|  
|Accept wildcard characters?|false|  
  
### -DeleteAll \<switch>  
 Deletes all [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] service applications, but does not delete the service application database, nor the service instance objects in the farm. [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service and [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Engine Service objects remain instantiated, but unusable, after you remove the service applications.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Required?|false|  
|Position?|named|  
|Default value||  
|Accept pipeline input?|false|  
|Accept wildcard characters?|false|  
  
### -RemoveData \<switch>  
 Removes the service application database that contains data refresh schedules, workbooks usage data, instance maps used to track which databases are loaded, and other internal data.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Required?|false|  
|Position?|named|  
|Default value||  
|Accept pipeline input?|false|  
|Accept wildcard characters?|false|

## Example 1  
  
```  
C:\PS>Remove-PowerPivotServiceApplication -identity 12345678-90ab-cdef-ghijklmnop  
```  
  
 This example deletes a single [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] service application, but does not remove its database or cache. If you do not specify an identity, you will be prompted to provide one.  
  
## Example 2  
  
```  
C:\PS>Remove-PowerPivotServiceApplication -DeleteAll  
```  
  
 This example deletes all [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] service applications in the farm. Databases and cache are not deleted.  
  
## Example 3  
  
```  
CC:\PS>Remove-PowerPivotServiceApplication -identity 12345678-90ab-cdef-ghijklmnop -RemoveData  
```  
  
 This example deletes a single [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] service application, and its database and cache files.
