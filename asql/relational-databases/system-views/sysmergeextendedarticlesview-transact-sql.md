|**view_sel_proc**|**nvarchar(290)**|The name of a stored procedure that the Merge Agent uses for doing the initial population of an article in a dynamically filtered publication, and for enumerating changed rows in any filtered publication.|  
|**gen_cur**|**int**|The generate number for local changes to the base table of an article.|  
|**excluded_cols**|**varbinary(128)**|The bitmap of the columns excluded from the article when it is sent to the Subscriber.|  
|**excluded_col_count**|**int**|The number of columns excluded.|  
|**vertical_partition**|**int**|Specifies whether column filtering is enabled on a table article. **0** indicates there is no vertical filtering and publishes all columns.|  
|**identity_support**|**int**|Specifies whether automatic identity range handling is enabled. **1** means that identity range handling is enabled, and **0** means that there is no identity range support.|  
|**destination_owner**|**sysname**|The name of the owner of the destination object.|  
|**before_image_objid**|**int**|The tracking table object ID. The tracking table contains certain key column values when a publication is configured to enable partition change optimizations.|  
|**before_view_objid**|**int**|The object ID of a view table. The view is on a table that tracks whether a row belonged at a particular Subscriber before it was deleted or updated. Applies only when a publication is created with *@keep_partition_changes* = **true**.|  
|**verify_resolver_signature**|**int**|Specifies whether a digital signature is verified before using a resolver in merge replication:<br /><br /> **0** = Signature is not verified.<br /><br /> **1** = Signature is verified to see whether it is from a trusted source.|  
|**allow_interactive_resolver**|**bit**|Specifies whether the use of the Interactive Resolver on an article is enabled. **1** specifies that the Interactive Resolver is used on the article.|

|**check_permissions**|**int**|The bitmap of the table-level permissions that will be verified when the Merge Agent applies changes to the Publisher. *check_permissions* can have one of these values:<br /><br /> **0x00** = Permissions are not checked.<br /><br /> **0x10** = Checks permissions at the Publisher before INSERTs made at a Subscriber can be uploaded.<br /><br /> **0x20** = Checks permissions at the Publisher before UPDATEs made at a Subscriber can be uploaded.<br /><br /> **0x40** = Checks permissions at the Publisher before DELETEs made at a Subscriber can be uploaded.|  
|**maxversion_at_cleanup**|**int**|The highest generation for which the metadata is cleaned up.|  
|**processing_order**|**int**|Indicates the processing order of articles in a merge publication; where a value of **0** indicated that the article is unordered, and articles are processed in order from lowest to highest value. If two articles have the same value, they are processed concurrently. For more information, see [Specify the Processing Order of Merge Articles](../../relational-databases/replication/merge/specify-the-processing-order-of-merge-articles.md).|  
|**published_in_tran_pub**|**bit**|Indicates that an article in a merge publication is also published in a transactional publication.<br /><br /> **0** = Article is not published in a transactional article.<br /><br /> **1** = Article is also published in a transactional article.|

|**before_upd_view_objid**|**int**|The ID of the view of a table before updates.|  
|**delete_tracking**|**bit**|Indicates if deletes are replicated.<br /><br /> **0** = Deletes are not replicated.<br /><br /> **1** = Deletes are replicated, which is the default behavior for merge replication.<br /><br /> When the value of *delete_tracking* is **0**, rows deleted at the Subscriber must be manually removed at the Publisher, and rows deleted at the Publisher must be manually removed at the Subscriber.<br /><br /> Note: A value of **0** results in non-convergence.|  
|**compensate_for_errors**|**bit**|Indicates if compensating actions are taken when errors are encountered during synchronization.<br /><br /> **0** = Compensating actions are disabled.<br /><br /> **1** = Changes that cannot be applied at a Subscriber or Publisher always lead to compensating actions to undo these changes, which is the default behavior for merge replication.<br /><br /> Note: A value of **0** results in non-convergence.|  
|**pub_range**|**bigint**|The publisher identity range size.|  
|**range**|**bigint**|The size of the consecutive identity values that would be assigned to subscribers in an adjustment.|
