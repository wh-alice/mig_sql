# Add, Change, or Delete a Map or Map Layer (Report Builder and SSRS)
  A map is a collection of layers. When you add a map to a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] paginated report, you define the first layer. You can create additional layers by using the map layer wizard.  
  
 The easiest way to add, remove, or change options for a layer is to use the map layer wizard. You can also change options manually from the Map pane. To display the **Map** pane, click in the map on the report design surface. The following figure displays the parts of the pane:  
  
 ![rsMapLayerZone](../../reporting-services/report-design/media/rsmaplayerzone.gif "rsMapLayerZone")  
  
 Map layers are drawn from bottom to top in the order that they appear in the Map pane. In the previous figure, the tile layer is drawn first and the polygon layer is drawn last. Layers that are drawn later might hide map elements on layers that are drawn earlier. You can change the order of layers by using the arrow keys on the Map pane toolbar. To show or hide layers, toggle the visibility icon. You can change the transparency of a layer on the **Visibility** page of the **Layer Data** properties dialog box.  
  
 The following table displays the toolbar icons for the **Map** pane.

1.  Click the map until the Map pane appears.  
  
2.  On the toolbar, click the **Add Layer** button, and from the drop-down list, click the type of layer that you want to add: **Point**, **Line**, or **Polygon**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Although you can add a map layer and configure it manually, we recommend that you use the map layer wizard to add new layers. To launch the wizard from the Map pane toolbar, click the layer wizard button (![rs_IconMapLayerWizard](../../reporting-services/report-design/media/rs-iconmaplayerwizard.gif "rs_IconMapLayerWizard")).  
  
3.  Right-click the layer, and then click **Layer Data**.  
  
4.  In **Use spatial data from**, select the source of spatial data. Options vary based on your selection.  
  
     If you want to visualize analytical from your report on this layer, do the following:  
  
    1.  Click **Analytical data**.  
  
    2.  In **Analytical dataset**, click the name of the dataset that contains analytical data and the match fields to build a relationship between analytical and spatial data.  
  
    3.  Click **Add**.  
  
    4.  Type the name of the match field from the spatial dataset.  
  
    5.  Type the name of the match field from the analytical dataset.
