# Master Data Services Database
  The database contains all of the information for the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] system. It is central to a [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] deployment. The [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database:  
  
-   Stores the settings, database objects, and data required by the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] system.  
  
-   Contains staging tables that are used to process data from source systems.  
  
-   Provides a schema and database objects to store master data from source systems.  
  
-   Supports versioning functionality, including business rule validation and e-mail notifications.  
  
-   Provides views for subscribing systems that need to retrieve data from the database.
