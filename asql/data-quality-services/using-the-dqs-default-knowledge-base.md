# Using the DQS Default Knowledge Base
  This topic describes the default knowledge base, **DQS Data**, which is installed with [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../data-quality-services/includes/ssdqsnoversion-md.md)] (DQS). This is a pre-built default knowledge base that contains the following domains:  
  
-   **Country/Region**: Contains the conventional long (official name as designated by the country/region ) and short names (common name used in lists, on maps, etc. ), two-letter abbreviation, three-letter abbreviation and three-digit code for each location.  Leading value is set to the long country name.  
  
-   **Country/Region (three-letter leading)**: Contains the conventional long (official name as designated by the country/region) and short names (common name used in lists, on maps, and so on), two-letter abbreviation, three-letter abbreviation and three-digit code for each location.  Leading values is set to County three-letter abbreviation.  
  
-   **Country/Region (two-letter leading)**: Contains the conventional long (official name as designated by the country/region ) and short names (common name used in lists, on maps, etc. ), two-letter abbreviation, three-letter abbreviation and three-digit code for each location.  Leading value is set to the Country two-letter abbreviation.

-   **US â€“ State (2-letter heading)**: Contains the conventional long (official) name and two-letter abbreviation for each state in US. Leading value is set to the two-letter abbreviation state name.  
  
## Using the Default Knowledge Base  
 You can use the default DQS knowledge base, DQS Data, in the following ways:  
  
-   Quickly start and run a cleansing data quality project using the default knowledge base without first having to create a new knowledge base in DQS.  
  
-   Run the Domain Management, Knowledge Discovery, or Matching Policy activities on the default knowledge base. To do so, click **Open Knowledge Base** in the [Data Quality Client Home Screen](../data-quality-services/data-quality-client-home-screen.md), select the **DQS Data** knowledge base in the **Open Knowledge Base** screen, and then select the required activity in the **Select Activity** area. Click **Next** to proceed.  
  
-   Create a new knowledge base using the default knowledge base. To create a knowledge base from an existing knowledge base, see [Create a Knowledge Base](../data-quality-services/create-a-knowledge-base.md).  
  
-   Use it in the [DQS Cleansing component in Integration Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238830) and [Master Data Services Add-in for Excel](../master-data-services/microsoft-excel-add-in/data-quality-matching-in-the-mds-add-in-for-excel.md).
