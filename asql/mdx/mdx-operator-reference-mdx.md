# MDX Operator Reference (MDX)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  The Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) language supports arithmetic, logical, comparison, set, string, and unary operators. The following table lists the supported operators and their descriptions.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[-- &#40;Comment&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/--%20\(Comment\)%20\(MDX\).md)|Indicates comment text that is provided by the user.|  
|[- &#40;Except&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/-%20\(Except\)%20\(MDX\).md)|Performs a set operation that returns the difference between two sets, removing duplicate members.|  
|[- &#40;Negative&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/negative-mdx.md)|Performs a unary operation that returns the negative value of a numeric expression.|  
|[- &#40;Subtract&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/subtract-mdx.md)|Performs an arithmetic operation that subtracts one number from another number.|  
|[&#42; &#40;Crossjoin&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/*%20\(Crossjoin\)%20\(MDX\).md)|Performs a set operation that returns the cross product of two sets.|  
|[&#42; &#40;Multiply&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/multiply-mdx.md)|Performs an arithmetic operation that multiplies two numbers.|  
|[&#40;Divide&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/\(Divide\)%20\(MDX\).md)|Performs an arithmetic operation that divides one number by another number.|  
|[^ &#40;Power&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/power-mdx.md)|Performs an arithmetic operation that raises one number by another number.|  
|[Comment &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/comment-mdx.md)|Indicates comment text that is provided by the user.|  
|[&#40;Comment&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/\(Comment\)%20\(MDX\).md)|Indicates user-provided text.|  
|[: &#40;Range&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/range-mdx.md)|Performs a set operation that returns a naturally ordered set, with the two specified members as endpoints, and all members between the two specified members included as members of the set.|  
|[+ &#40;Add&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/add-mdx.md)|Performs an arithmetic operation that adds two numbers.|  
|[+ &#40;Positive&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/positive-mdx.md)|Performs a unary operation that returns the positive value of a numeric expression.|  
|[+ &#40;String Concatenation&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/string-concatenation-mdx.md)|Performs a string operation that concatenates two or more character strings, tuples, or a combination of strings and tuples.|  
|[+ &#40;Union&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/+%20\(Union\)%20\(MDX\).md)|Performs a set operation that returns a union of two sets, removing duplicates.|  
|[&#60; &#40;Less Than&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/less-than-mdx.md)|Performs a comparison operation that determines whether the value of one MDX expression is less than the value of another MDX expression.|  
|[&#60;= &#40;Less Than or Equal To&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/less-than-or-equal-to-mdx.md)|Performs a comparison operation that determines whether the value of one MDX expression is less than or equal to the value of another MDX expression.|  
|[&#60;&#62; &#40;Not Equal To&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/not-equal-to-mdx.md)|Performs a comparison operation that determines whether the value of one MDX expression is not equal to the value of another MDX expression.|  
|[= &#40;Equal To&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/equal-to-mdx.md)|Performs a comparison operation that determines whether the value of one MDX expression is equal to the value of another MDX expression.|  
|[&#62; &#40;Greater Than&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/greater-than-mdx.md)|Performs a comparison operation that determines whether the value of one MDX expression is greater than the value of another MDX expression.|  
|[&#62;= &#40;Greater Than or Equal To&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/greater-than-or-equal-to-mdx.md)|Performs a comparison operation that determines whether the value of one MDX expression is greater than or equal to the value of another MDX expression.|
