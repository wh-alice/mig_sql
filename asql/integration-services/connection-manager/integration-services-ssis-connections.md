# Integration Services (SSIS) Connections
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages use connections to perform different tasks and to implement [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] features:  
  
-   Connecting to source and destination data stores such as text, XML, Excel workbooks, and relational databases to extract and load data.  
  
-   Connecting to relational databases that contain reference data to perform exact or fuzzy lookups.  
  
-   Connecting to relational databases to run SQL statements such as SELECT, DELETE, and INSERT commands and also stored procedures.  
  
-   Connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to perform maintenance and transfer tasks such as backing up databases and transferring logins.  
  
-   Writing log entries in text and XML files and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tables and package configurations to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tables.  
  
-   Connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to create temporary work tables that some transformations require to do their work.  
  
-   Connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] projects and databases to access data mining models, process cubes and dimensions, and run DDL code.  
  
-   Specifying existing or creating new files and folders to use with Foreach Loop enumerators and tasks.  
  
-   Connecting to message queues and to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO), Web, and mail servers.  
  
 To make these connections, [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] uses connection managers, as described in the next section.  
  
## Connection Managers  
 [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] uses the connection manager as a logical representation of a connection. At design time, you set the properties of a connection manager to describe the physical connection that [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] creates when the package runs. For example, a connection manager includes the **ConnectionString** property that you set at design time; at run time, a physical connection is created using the value in the connection string property.  
  
 A package can use multiple instances of a connection manager type, and you can set the properties on each instance. At run time, each instance of a connection manager type creates a connection that has different attributes.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] provides different types of connection managers that enable packages to connect to a variety of data sources and servers:  
  
-   There are built-in connection managers that Setup installs when you install [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   There are connection managers that are available for download from the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] website.  
  
-   You can create your own custom connection manager if the existing connection managers do not meet your needs.  

### Package level and project level connection managers
A connection manager can be created at the package level or at the project level. The connection manager created at the project level is available all the packages in the project. Whereas, connection manager created at the package level is available to that specific package.  
  
 You use connection managers that are created at the project level in place of data sources, to share connections to sources. To add a connection manager at the project level, the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project must use the project deployment model. When a project is configured to use this model, the **Connection Managers** folder appears in **Solution Explorer**, and the **Data Sources** folder is removed from **Solution Explorer**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to use data sources in your package, you need to convert the project to the package deployment model.  
>   
>  For more information about the two models, see [Deploy Integration Services (SSIS) Projects and Packages](../../integration-services/packages/deploy-integration-services-ssis-projects-and-packages.md). For more information about converting a project to the project deployment model, see [Deploy Projects to Integration Services Server](../../integration-services/packages/deploy-projects-to-integration-services-server.md).

For more information, see the download page, [Microsoft Connectors for Oracle and Teradata by Attunity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=251526).|  
  
### Custom Connection Managers  
 You can also write custom connection managers. For more information, see [Developing a Custom Connection Manager](../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/connection-manager/developing-a-custom-connection-manager.md).  
  
## Create connection managers
  [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] includes a variety of connection managers to suit the needs of tasks that connect to different types of servers and data sources. Connection managers are used by the data flow components that extract and load data in different types of data stores, and by the log providers that write logs to a server, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table, or file. For example, a package with a Send Mail task uses an SMTP connection manager type to connect to a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. A package with an Execute SQL task can use an OLE DB connection manager to connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database. For more information, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Connections](../../integration-services/connection-manager/integration-services-ssis-connections.md).  
  
 To automatically create and configure connection managers when you create a new package, you can use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard. The wizard also helps you create and configure the sources and destinations that use the connection managers. For more information, see [Create Packages in SQL Server Data Tools](../../integration-services/create-packages-in-sql-server-data-tools.md).  
  
 To manually create a new connection manager and add it to an existing package, you use the **Connection Managers** area that appears on the **Control Flow**, **Data Flow**, and **Event Handlers** tabs of [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../analysis-services/instances/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer. From the **Connection Manager** area, you choose the type of connection manager to create, and then set the properties of the connection manager by using a dialog box that [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../analysis-services/instances/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer provides. For more information, see the section, "Using the Connection Managers Area," later in this topic.  
  
 After the connection manager is added to a package, you can use it in tasks, Foreach Loop containers, sources, transformations, and destinations. For more information, see [Integration Services Tasks](../../integration-services/control-flow/integration-services-tasks.md), [Foreach Loop Container](../../integration-services/control-flow/foreach-loop-container.md), and [Data Flow](../../integration-services/data-flow/data-flow.md).  
  
### Using the Connection Managers Area  
 You can create connection managers while the **Control Flow**, **Data Flow**, or **Event Handlers** tab of [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../analysis-services/instances/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer is active.  
  
 The following diagram shows the **Connection Managers** area on the **Control Flow** tab of [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../analysis-services/instances/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer.  
  
 ![Screenshot of control flow designer with package](../../integration-services/connection-manager/media/samplecontrolflow.gif "Screenshot of control flow designer with package")    
  
### 32-Bit and 64-Bit Providers for Connection Managers  
 Many of the providers that connection managers use are available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] design environment is a 32-bit environment and you see only 32-bit providers while you are designing a package. Therefore, you can only configure a connection manager to use a specific 64-bit provider if the 32-bit version of the same provider is also installed.  
  
 At run time, the correct version is used, and it does not matter that you specified the 32-bit version of the provider at design time. The 64-bit version of the provider can be run even if the package is run in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 Both versions of the provider have the same ID. To specify whether the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] runtime uses an available 64-bit version of the provider, you set the Run64BitRuntime property of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project. If the Run64BitRuntime property is set to **true**, the runtime finds and uses the 64-bit provider; if Run64BitRuntime is **false**, the runtime finds and uses the 32-bit provider. For more information about properties you can set on [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] projects, see [Integration Services &(SSIS) and Studio Environments](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms140028.aspx).  

## Add a connection manager
###  <a name="wizard"></a> Add a connection manager when you create a package  
  
-   Use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard  
  
     In addition to creating and configuring a connection manager, the wizard also helps you create and configure the sources and destinations that use the connection manager. For more information, see [Create Packages in SQL Server Data Tools](../../integration-services/create-packages-in-sql-server-data-tools.md).  
  
###  <a name="package"></a> Add a connection manager to an existing package  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it  
  
3.  In [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../analysis-services/instances/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer, click the **Control Flow** tab, the **Data Flow** tab, or the **Event Handler** tab to make the **Connection Managers** area available.  
  
4.  Right-click anywhere in the **Connection Managers** area, and then do one of the following:  
  
    -   Click the connection manager type to add to the package.  
  
         —or—  
  
    -   If the type that you want to add is not listed, click **New Connection** to open the **Add SSIS Connection Manager** dialog box, select a connection manager type, and then click **OK**.  
  
     The custom dialog box for the selected connection manager type opens. For more information about connection manager types and the options that are available, see the following options table.

     The connection manager you added will show up under the **Connections Managers** node in the **Solution Explorer**. It will also appear in the **Connection Managers** tab in the **SSIS Designer** window for all the packages in the project. The name of the connection manager in this tab will have a **(project)** prefix in order to differentiate this project level connection manager from the package level connection managers.  
  
4.  Optionally, right-click the connection manager in the **Solution Explorer** window under **Connection Managers** node (or) in the **Connection Managers** tab of the **SSIS Designer** window, click **Rename**, and then modify the default name of the connection manager.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In the **Connection Managers** tab of the **SSIS Designer** window, you won’t be able to overwrite the **(project)** prefix from the connection manager name. This is by design.

2.  Click OK to delete the connection manager or Cancel to keep it.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also delete a project level connection manager from the **Connection Manager** tab of the **SSIS Designer** window opened for any package in the project. You do so by right-clicking the connection manager in the tab and then by clicking **Delete**. 
    
## Set the Properties of a Connection Manager
All connection managers can be configured using the **Properties** window.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] also provides custom dialog boxes for modifying the different types of connection managers in [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]. The dialog box has a different set of options depending on the connection manager type.  
  
### Modify a connection manager using the Properties window  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  In SSIS Designer, click the **Control Flow** tab, the **Data Flow** tab, or the **Event Handler** tab to make the **Connection Managers** area available.
