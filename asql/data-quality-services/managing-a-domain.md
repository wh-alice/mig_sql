# Managing a Domain
  This topic describes the use of domains in [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../data-quality-services/includes/ssdqsnoversion-md.md)] (DQS). A domain contains a semantic representation of the data in a specific field in the data source that is to be analyzed. A domain is part of the knowledge base that you create for a data source, and the knowledge that you build up by analyzing a sample data source, or importing data, is added to the domains defined in the knowledge base. The knowledge in those domains is later used to perform cleansing and matching in a data quality project. Domains are at the core of all activities in Data Quality Services.  
  
 A domain is mapped to a data source field, and is populated in the knowledge discovery, domain management, and matching activities. How you load data from the data source and output data in a report is defined in domain properties. When you use a reference data provider to cleanse data, you attach a reference data service to a single or composite domain. You create rules to be applied to your data in a domain, and you can create term-based relations for a domain. You can view and correct data in the domain.  
  
 You can also create a composite domain that is comprised of two or more individual domains that each contains knowledge about common data. For more information, see [Managing a Composite Domain](../data-quality-services/managing-a-composite-domain.md).  
  
## Domain Properties  
 When you create a domain, you have the following options for how to populate the domain from the source data and how to output the domain values. For more information, see [Set Domain Properties](../data-quality-services/set-domain-properties.md).  
  
-   Select the type of the data that you populate the domain with. For information about data types supported for each domain data type, see [Supported SQL Server and SSIS Data Types for DQS Domains](../data-quality-services/supported-sql-server-and-ssis-data-types-for-dqs-domains.md).  
  
-   Specify that only leading values, not their synonyms, will be output from the domain.  
  
-   Specify that domain values be output in a certain format, depending on the data type.  
  
-   If the data type is a string, you can normalize the string by removing special characters when the string is loaded from the data source into the domain.  
  
-   If the data type is a string, you can run the DQS Speller to check the syntax, spelling, and sentence structure of the string, and indicate any potential errors in the **Domain Values** page of **Domain Management**. This includes specifying the language that the Speller will run in.  
  
-   If the data type is a string, you can specify that DQS not identify syntax errors when you know that syntax errors will not occur in strings.
