# Revert the Word Breakers Used by Search to the Previous Version
  [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] installs and enables a version of the word breakers and stemmers for all languages supported by Full-Text Search with the exception of Korean. This topic describes how to switch from this version of these components to the previous version, or to switch back from the previous version to the new version.  
  
 This topic does not discuss the following languages:  
  
-   **English**. To revert or restore the English components, see [Change the Word Breaker Used for US English and UK English](../../relational-databases/search/change-the-word-breaker-used-for-us-english-and-uk-english.md).  
  
-   **Danish, Polish, and Turkish**. The third-party word breakers for Danish, Polish, and Turkish that were included with previous releases of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] have been replaced with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] components.  
  
-   **Czech and Greek**. There are new word breakers for Czech and Greek. Previous releases of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Full-Text Search did not include support for these two languages.  
  
-   **Korean**. The word breaker and stemmer for the Korean language are not upgraded in this release.  
  
 For general information about word breakers and stemmers, see [Configure and Manage Word Breakers and Stemmers for Search](../../relational-databases/search/configure-and-manage-word-breakers-and-stemmers-for-search.md).  
  
##  <a name="overview"></a> Overview of reverting and restoring word breakers and stemmers  
 The instructions for reverting and restoring word breakers and stemmers depend on the language. The following table summarizes the 3 sets of actions that may be required to revert to the previous version of the components.  
  
|Current file|Previous file|Number of affected languages|Action for files|Action for registry entries|  
|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|  
|NaturalLanguage6.dll|NaturalLanguage6.dll|34|Obtain and install a previous version of NaturalLanguage6.dll, overwriting the current version of the file.|No action required.<br /><br /> The registry keys and values have not changed for this release.|  
|(Other file name)|NaturalLanguage6.dll|5|Obtain and install a previous version of NaturalLanguage6.dll, overwriting the current version of the file.|Change a set of registry entries to specify the previous version of the components.|  
|(Other file name)|(Other file name)|6|No action required.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] setup copies both the current and the previous versions of the components to the Binn folder.|Change a set of registry entries to specify the previous version of the components.|  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  If you replace the current version of the file NaturalLanguage6.dll with a different version, then the behavior of all the languages that use this file is affected.  
  
 The files described in this topic are DLL files that are installed in the `MSSQL\Binn` folder for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. The full path is typically the following path:  
  
 `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\<instance>\MSSQL\Binn`  
  
##  <a name="nl6nl6"></a> Languages for which the file name of both the current and previous word breaker is NaturalLanguage6.dll  
 For the languages in the following table, the file name of both the current and previous word breaker is NaturalLanguage6.dll. To revert or restore these components, you have to overwrite NaturalLanguage6.dll with a different version of the same file. You do not have to change any registry entries, because the registry entries have not changed for this release.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  If you replace the current version of the file NaturalLanguage6.dll with a different version, then the behavior of all the languages that use this file is affected.

 For the languages in the following table, the file names of the previous word breakers and stemmers are different from the file names of the new versions. Neither the previous nor the current file name is NaturalLanguage6.dll. You do not have to replace any files, because [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] setup copies both the current and the previous versions of the components to the Binn folder. However you have to change a set of registry entries to specify the previous or current version of the components.
