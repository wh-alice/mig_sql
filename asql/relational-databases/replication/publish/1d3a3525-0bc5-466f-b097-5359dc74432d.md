# Publish the Execution of a Stored Procedure in a Transactional Publication (SQL Server Management Studio)
  Specify that the execution of a stored procedure (rather than just its definition) should be published in the **Article Properties - \<Article>** dialog box. This dialog box is available in the New Publication Wizard and the **Publication Properties - \<Publication>** dialog box. For more information about using the wizard and accessing the dialog box, see [Create a Publication](../../../relational-databases/replication/publish/create-a-publication.md) and [View and Modify Publication Properties](../../../relational-databases/replication/publish/view-and-modify-publication-properties.md).  
  
 The definition of the procedure (the CREATE PROCEDURE statement) is replicated to the Subscriber when the subscription is initialized; when the procedure is executed at the Publisher, replication executes the corresponding procedure at the Subscriber.  
  
### To publish the execution of a stored procedure  
  
1.  On the **Articles** page of the New Publication Wizard or the **Publication Properties - \<Publication>** dialog box, select a stored procedure.  
  
2.  Click **Article Properties**, and then click **Set Properties of Highlighted Stored Procedure**.  
  
3.  In the **Article Properties - \<Article>** dialog box, specify one of the following values for the **Replicate** option:  
  
    -   **Execution of the stored procedure**  
  
    -   **Execution in a serialized transaction of the SP**  
  
         This is the recommended option, because it replicates the procedure execution only if the procedure is executed within the context of a serializable transaction. If the stored procedure is executed outside of a serializable transaction, changes to data in published tables are replicated as a series of data manipulation language (DML) statements.  
  
4.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
5.  If you are in the **Publication Properties - \<Publication>** dialog box, click **OK** to save and close the dialog box.
