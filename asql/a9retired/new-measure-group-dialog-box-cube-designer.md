# New Measure Group Dialog Box (Cube Designer)
  Use the **New Measure Group** dialog box in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to add a new measure group to a cube in Cube Designer. You can display the **New Measure Group** dialog box by:  
  
-   Clicking **New Measure Group** in the **Toolbar** pane on the **Cube Structure** tab in Cube Designer.  
  
-   Right-clicking a measure group or measure in the **Measures** pane on the **Cube Structure** tab in Cube Designer and selecting **New Measure Group** from the context menu.  
  
## Options  
 **Select a table from the data source view**  
 Select the fact table for the new measure group. Tables cannot be used more than once as fact tables within the same cube.
