# WMI Provider for Server Events Concepts
  The WMI Provider for Server Events lets you use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to monitor events in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Understanding the WMI Provider for Server Events](../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/understanding-the-wmi-provider-for-server-events.md)  
 Provides an overview of the provider architecture and how SQL Server Agent can be programmed to work with it.  
  
 [Working with the WMI Provider for Server Events](../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/working-with-the-wmi-provider-for-server-events.md)  
 Explains the factors that you need to consider before programming with the provider.  
  
 [Using WQL with the WMI Provider for Server Events](../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/using-wql-with-the-wmi-provider-for-server-events.md)  
 Explains the WMI Query Language (WQL) syntax and how to use it when you program against the provider.  
  
 [Sample: Creating a SQL Server Agent Alert by Using the WMI Provider for Server Events](../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/sample-creating-a-sql-server-agent-alert-with-the-wmi-provider.md)  
 Provides an example of using the WMI Provider to return trace event information on which to create a SQL Server Agent alert.  
  
 [Sample: Use the WMI Event Provider with the .NET Framework](../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/sample-using-the-wmi-event-provider-with-the-.net-framework.md)  
 Provides an example of using the WMI Provider to return event data in a C# application.  
  
 [WMI Provider for Server Events Classes and Properties](../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/wmi-provider-for-server-events-classes-and-properties.md)  
 Introduces the event classes and properties that make up the programming mode of the provider.
