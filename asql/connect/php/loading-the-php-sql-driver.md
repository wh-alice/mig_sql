# Loading the PHP SQL Driver
![Download](../../ssdt/media/download.png)[Download PHP Driver](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=20098)

This topic provides instructions for loading the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server into the PHP process space.  
  
There are two options for loading a driver. The driver can be loaded when PHP is started or it can be loaded at PHP script runtime.  
  
## Moving the Driver File into Your Extension Directory  
Regardless of which procedure you use, the first step will be to put the driver file in a directory where the PHP runtime can find it. So, put the driver file in your PHP extension directory. See [System Requirements for the PHP SQL Driver](../../connect/php/system-requirements-for-the-php-sql-driver.md) for a list of the driver files that are installed with the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server.  
  
If necessary, specify the directory location of the driver file in the PHP configuration file (php.ini), using the **extension_dir** option. For example, if you will put the driver file in your c:\php\ext directory, use this option:  
  
```  
extension_dir = "c:\PHP\ext"  
```  
  
## Loading the Driver at PHP Startup  
To load the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server when PHP is started, first move a driver file into your extension directory. Then, follow these steps:  
  
1.  To enable the **SQLSRV** driver, modify **php.ini** by adding the following line to the extension section, or modifying the line that is already there:  
  
    On Windows (this example uses the version 4.0 thread safe driver for PHP 7): 
    ```  
    extension=php_sqlsrv_7_ts.dll  
    ```  
    On Linux (this example uses the version as installed by PECL): 
    ```  
    extension=sqlsrv.so  
    ```  
    To enable the **PDO_SQLSRV** driver, modify **php.ini** by adding the following line to the extension section, or modifying the line that is already there:  
  
    On Windows (this example uses the version 4.0 thread safe driver for PHP 7):
    ```  
    extension=php_pdo_sqlsrv_7_ts.dll  
    ```  
    On Linux (this example uses the version as installed by PECL):
    ```  
    extension=pdo_sqlsrv.so  
    ```  
  
2.  If you want to use the **PDO_SQLSRV** driver, the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension must be available, either as a built-in extension, or as a dynamically-loaded extension. If you need to load the PDO_SQLSRV driver dynamically, the php_pdo.dll (or pdo.so on Linux) must be present in the extension directory and the following line needs to be in the php.ini:

    On Windows:  
    ```
    extension=php_pdo.dll  
    ```  
    On Linux:  
    ```
    extension=pdo.so  
    ```  
  
3.  Restart the Web server.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> To determine whether the driver has been successfully loaded, run a script that calls [phpinfo()](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=108678).  
  
For more information about **php.ini** directives, see [Description of core php.ini directives](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=105817).  
  
## Loading the Driver at PHP Script Runtime  
To load the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server at script runtime, first move a driver file into your extension directory. Then include the following line at the start of the PHP script that matches the filename of the driver:  
  
```  
dl('php_pdo_sqlsrv_7_ts.dll');  
```  
  
For more information about PHP functions related to dynamically loading extensions, see [dl](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=105818) and [extension_loaded.](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=105819)
