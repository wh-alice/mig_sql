# PermissionSet Element (ASSL)
  Identifies the permission set associated with a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework assembly.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
  
<ClrAssembly>  
   ...  
   <PermissionSet>...</PermissionSet>  
  
</ClrAssembly>  
```  
  
## Element Characteristics  
  
|Characteristic|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|Data type and length|String (enumeration)|  
|Default value|*Safe*|  
|Cardinality|0-1: Optional element that can occur once and only once.|  
  
## Element Relationships  
  
|Relationship|Element|  
|------------------|-------------|  
|Parent element|[ClrAssembly](../../../analysis-services/scripting/data-type/clrassembly-data-type-assl.md)|  
|Child elements|None|  
  
## Remarks  
 The value of this element is limited to one of the strings listed in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|*Safe*|Only internal computation and local data access is allowed. *Safe* is the most restrictive permission set. Code executed by an assembly with *Safe* permissions cannot access external system resources such as files, the network, environment variables, or the registry.|  
|*ExternalAccess*|*Safe*, with the additional ability to access external system resources such as files, networks, environmental variables, and the registry.|  
|*Unrestricted*|Unrestricted allows assemblies unrestricted access to resources, both within and outside [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Code executing from within an *Unrestricted* assembly can call unmanaged code.|  
  
 The enumeration that corresponds to the allowed values for **PermissionSet** in the Analysis Management Objects (AMO) object model is <xref:Microsoft.AnalysisServices.PermissionSet>.
