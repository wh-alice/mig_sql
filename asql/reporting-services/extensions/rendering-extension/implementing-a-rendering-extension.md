# Implementing a Rendering Extension
  A rendering extension is a component or module of a report server that transforms report data and layout information into a device-specific format. SQL Server Reporting Services includes six rendering extensions: HTML, Excel, Word, CSV or Text, XML, Image, and PDF. You can create additional rendering extensions to generate reports in other formats.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To determine which rendering extensions are available, you can view the list of installed extensions in the RSReportServer.config file.
