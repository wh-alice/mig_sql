# IMDEmbeddedData Interface
  The IMDEmbeddedData interface is a public interface used to manage an embedded [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] database or a tabular model database. The interface inherits from the **IPersistStream** interface. The interface allows for the following operations:  
  
-   Get an identifier to the embedded stream in the container document.  
  
-   Set the URL of the containing document.  
  
-   Set a flag to indicate if the embedding application is in a hosted environment.  
  
-   Set the path to temporary files used by the embedding application.  
  
-   Cancel the current embedded operation.  
  
-   Get the estimated size (in bytes) of the stream to save the embedded object. Inherited from **IPersistStream**.  
  
-   Verify if the embedded database has changed since it was last saved. Inherited from **IPersistStream**.  
  
-   Load the embedded database to the local or in-process engine. Inherited from **IPersistStream**.  
  
-   Save the local or in-process database to the embedded stream in the container document. Inherited from **IPersistStream**.  
  
## Reference  
 The following reference documents the **IMDEmbeddedData** interface as presented in **msmd.h** header file.

#### Remarks  
 To verify if the current connection contains an embedded database, the user should check the value of the DBPROP_MSMD_EMBEDDED_DATA property from the OLE DB connection properties.  
  
 The possible values for DBPROP_MSMD_EMBEDDED_DATA are:  
  
|Name|Value|Definition|  
|----------|-----------|----------------|  
|DBPROPVAL_EMBED_NONE|0x00|No embedded database available|
