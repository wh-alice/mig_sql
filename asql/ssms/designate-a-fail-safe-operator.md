# Designate a Fail-Safe Operator
A fail-safe operator is a user who receives the alert if the designated operator cannot be reached. This topic describes how to set a fail-safe operator to receive Microsoft SQL Server Agent alert notifications in SQL Server 2016 by using SQL Server Management Studio.

### <a name="Restrictions"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   The Pager and **net send** options will be removed from SQL Server Agent in a future version of MicrosoftSQL Server. Avoid using these features in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use these features.  
  
-   Note that SQL Server Agent must be configured to use Database Mail to send e-mail and pager notifications to operators. For more information, see [Assign Alerts to an Operator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms190038.aspx).  
  
-   SQL Server Management Studio provides an easy, graphical way to manage jobs, and is the recommended way to create and manage the job infrastructure.
