|**max_concurrent_merge**|**int**|The maximum number of allowed concurrent merge processes. A value of **0** for this property means that there is no limit to the number of concurrent merge processes running at any given time. This property sets a limit as to the number of concurrent merge processes that can be run against a merge publication at one time. If there are more snapshot processes scheduled at the same time than the value allows to run, then the excess jobs will be put into a queue and wait until a currently-running merge process finishes.|  
|**max_concurrent_dynamic_snapshots**|**int**|The maximum number of allowed concurrent filtered data snapshot sessions that can be running against the merge publication. If **0**, there is no limit to the maximum number of concurrent filtered data snapshot sessions that can run simultaneously against the publication at any given time. This property sets a limit as to the number of concurrent snapshot processes that can be run against a merge publication at one time.

|**web_synchronization_url**|**nvarchar(500)**|Specifies the default value of the Internet URL used for Web synchronization.|  
|**allow_partition_realignment**|**bit**|Indicates whether deletes are sent to the subscriber when modification of the row on the publisher causes it to change its partition.<br /><br /> **0** = Data from an old partition will be left on the subscriber, where changes made to this data on the publisher will not replicate to this Subscriber, but changes made on the Subscriber will replicate to the Publisher.<br /><br /> **1** = Deletes to the Subscriber to reflect the results of a partition change by removing data that is not longer part of the Subscriber's partition.<br /><br /> For more information, see [sp_addmergepublication &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addmergepublication-transact-sql.md).<br /><br /> Note: Data that remains at the Subscriber when this value is **0** should be treated as if it were read-only; however, this is not strictly enforced by the replication system.|
