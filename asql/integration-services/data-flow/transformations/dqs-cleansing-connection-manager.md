# DQS Cleansing Connection Manager
  A DQS Cleansing connection manager enables a package to connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../../../data-quality-services/includes/ssdqsnoversion-md.md)] server. The DQS Cleansing transformation uses the DQS Cleansing connection manager.  
  
 For more information about Data Quality Services, see [Data Quality Services Concepts](../../../data-quality-services/data-quality-services-concepts.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The DQS Cleansing connection manager supports only Windows Authentication.
