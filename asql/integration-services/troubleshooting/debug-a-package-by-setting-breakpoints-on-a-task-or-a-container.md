# Debug a Package by Setting Breakpoints on a Task or a Container
  This procedure describes how to set breakpoints in a package, a task, a For Loop container, a Foreach Loop container, or a Sequence container.  
  
### To set breakpoints in a package, a task, or a container  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  Double-click the package in which you want to set breakpoints.  
  
3.  In SSIS Designer, do the following:  
  
    -   To set breakpoints in the package object, click the **Control Flow** tab, place the cursor anywhere on the background of the design surface, right-click, and then click **Edit Breakpoints**.  
  
    -   To set breakpoints in a package control flow, click the **Control Flow** tab, right-click a task, a For Loop container, a Foreach Loop container, or a Sequence container, and then click **Edit Breakpoints**.  
  
    -   To set breakpoints in an event handler, click the **Event Handler** tab, right-click a task, a For Loop container, a Foreach Loop container, or a Sequence container, and then click **Edit Breakpoints**.  
  
4.  In the **Set Breakpoints \<container name>** dialog box, select the breakpoints to enable.  
  
5.  Optionally, modify the hit count type and the hit count number for each breakpoint.  
  
6.  To save the package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.
