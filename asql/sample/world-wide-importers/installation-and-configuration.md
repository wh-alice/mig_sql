# WideWorldImportersDW Installation and configuration
Installation and configuration instructions for the WideWorldImportersDW database.

- [SQL Server 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2016) (or higher) or [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/). To use the Full version of the sample, use SQL Server Evaluation/Developer/Enterprise Edition.
- [SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx). For the best results use the June 2016 release or later.

## Download

The latest release of the sample:

[wide-world-importers-release](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=800630)

Download the sample WideWorldImportersDW database backup/bacpac that corresponds to your edition of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.

Source code to recreate the sample database is available from the following location. Note that data population is based on ETL from the OLTP database (WideWorldImporters):

[wide-world-importers-source](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/wide-world-importers/wwi-dw-database-scripts)

## Install


### SQL Server

To restore a backup to a SQL Server instance, you can use Management Studio.

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the target SQL Server instance.
2. Right-click on the **Databases** node, and select **Restore Database**.
3. Select **Device** and click on the button **...**
4. In the dialog **Select backup devices**, click **Add**, navigate to the database backup in the filesystem of the server, and select the backup. Click **OK**.
5. If needed, change the target location for the data and log files, in the **Files** pane. Note that it is best practice to place data and log files on different drives.
6. Click **OK**. This will initiate the database restore. After it completes, you will have the database WideWorldImporters installed on your SQL Server instance.

### Azure SQL Database

To import a bacpac into a new SQL Database, you can use Management Studio.

1. (optional) If you do not yet have a SQL Server in Azure, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and create a new SQL Database. In the process of create a database, you will create a server. Make note of the server.
   - See [this tutorial](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-get-started/) to create a database in minutes
2. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to your server in Azure.
3. Right-click on the **Databases** node, and select **Import Data-Tier Application**.
4. In the **Import Settings** select **Import from local disk** and select the bacpac of the sample database from your file system.
5. Under **Database Settings** change the database name to *WideWorldImportersDW* and select the target edition and service objective to use.
6. Click **Next** and **Finish** to kick off deployment. It will take a few minutes to complete. When specifying a service objective lower than S2 it may take longer.

## Configuration

[Applies to SQL Server 2016 (and later) Developer/Evaluation/Enterprise Edition]

The sample database can make use of PolyBase to query files in Hadoop or Azure blob storage. However, that feature is not installed by default with SQL Server - you need to select it during SQL Server setup. Therefore, a post-installation step is required.

1. In SQL Server Management Studio, connect to the WideWorldImportersDW database and open a new query window.
2. Run the following T-SQL command to enable the use of PolyBase in the database:

   EXECUTE [Application].[Configuration_ApplyPolyBase]
