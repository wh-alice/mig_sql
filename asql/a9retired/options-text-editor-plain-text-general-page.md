# Options (Text Editor/Plain Text/General Page)
  Use this dialog box to change the general editing behavior of the Text Editor, which is used to edit a document not associated with a particular development language. To display these settings, click **Options** on the **Tools** menu, expand **Text Editor**, expand **Plain Text,** and then click **General**.  
  
## Setting Options in Multiple Locations  
 Options for the Plain Text Editor can also be set in the **All Languages General** dialog. If you use the **All Languages** dialogs to set different options for the other SQL Server Management Studio editors, such as the DMX or MDX editors, you must reset the Plain Text Editor options using this dialog.  
  
## Statement Completion  
 **Auto list members**  
 The plain text editor does not support this feature.  
  
 **Hide advanced members**  
 The plain text editor does not support this feature.  
  
 **Parameter information**  
 The plain text editor does not support this feature.  
  
## Settings  
 **Enable virtual space**  
 Insert spaces at the end of each line of text. Select this check box to position comments at a consistent point next to your text.  
  
 **Word wrap**  
 Display any portion of a line that extends horizontally beyond the viewable editor area on the next line. Selecting this check box enables the **Show visual glyphs for word wrap** option.  
  
 **Show visual glyphs for word wrap**  
 Display a return-arrow indicator where a long line wraps onto a second line. Clear this check box if you prefer not to display these indicators.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  These reminder arrows are not added to your code, and they do not print. They are for reference only.  
  
 **Apply Cut/Copy commands to blank lines when there is no selection**  
 Set the behavior of the editor when you place the insertion point on a blank line, select nothing, and then click **Copy** or **Cut**.  
  
 When this check box is selected, the blank line is copied or cut. If you then click **Paste**, a new, blank line is inserted.  
  
 When this check box is cleared, nothing is copied or cut. If you then click **Paste**, the content most recently copied is pasted. If nothing has been copied, nothing is pasted.  
  
 This setting has no effect on **Copy** or **Cut** when a line is not blank. If nothing is selected, the entire line is copied or cut. If you then click **Paste**, the text of the entire line and its end line character are pasted.  
  
## Display  
 **Line numbers**  
 Display a line number next to each line of text.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  These line numbers are not added to your text, and they do not print. They are for reference only.  
  
 **Enable single-click URL navigation**  
 Change the cursor to a pointing hand as it passes over a URL in the editor. You can click the URL to display the indicated page in your Web browser.  
  
 **Navigation bar**  
 This check box is unavailable.
