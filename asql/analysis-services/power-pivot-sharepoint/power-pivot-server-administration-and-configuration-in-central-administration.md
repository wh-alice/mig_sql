# Power Pivot Server Administration and Configuration in Central Administration
  [!INCLUDE[ssGemini_md](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] server administration and configuration is performed by SharePoint service application administrators, using SharePoint Central Administration.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssGemini_md](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint must be configured before it can be used. After you install [!INCLUDE[ssGemini_md](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint using SQL Server Setup, you can configure it using any of the following approaches:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssGemini_md](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Configuration Tool or [!INCLUDE[ssGemini_md](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint 2013 Configuration tool  
  
-   SharePoint Central Administration  
  
-   PowerShell cmdlets  
  
 All three approaches deliver a fully configured server.  
  
 This section includes tasks for configuring the software using Central Administration. At a minimum, you must perform all three of the required configuration tasks noted in the list below.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  For SharePoint 2010, SharePoint 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1) must be installed before you can configure either [!INCLUDE[ssGemini_md](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint, or a SharePoint farm that uses a [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] database server. If you have not yet installed the service pack, do so now before you begin configuring the server.  
  
## Benefits of Configuring Power Pivot for SharePoint Using Central Administration  
 SharePoint Central Administration is the administrative application of a SharePoint farm. If you are farm administrator, you might prefer to use a familiar tool when adding a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini_md](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint instance to your farm.  
  
 In contrast with the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini_md](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Configuration Tools or PowerShell cmdlets, Central Administration provides pages that fully specify all of the options you might set when configuring an application or server. Other approaches either condense the configuration workflow into a fewer number of steps, or require prior knowledge of how to configure a SharePoint server using PowerShell.
