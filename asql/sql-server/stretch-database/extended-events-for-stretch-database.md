# Extended Events for Stretch Database
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Stretch Database provides a set of extended events for troubleshooting.  
  
For more info, see [Extended Events](../../relational-databases/extended-events/extended-events.md). For info about how to start an extended events session for troubleshooting, see [Create an Extended Events Session](../../a9retired/create-an-extended-events-session.md)
