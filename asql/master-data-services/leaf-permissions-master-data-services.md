# Leaf Permissions (Master Data Services)
  Leaf permissions apply to the attribute values for all leaf members of an entity.  
  
 For entities without explicit hierarchies enabled, assigning permission to **Leaf** is the same as assigning permission to the entity.  
  
 **Notes:**  
  
-   Leaf permissions apply to the **Explorer** functional area of the user interface only.  
  
-   Permissions assigned to **Name** and **Code** attributes are not enforced.  
  
|Permission|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**Read**|User can read leaf members, attributes.|  
|**Create**|User can create leaf members, and assign attribute values during create.|  
|**Update**|User can update leaf members and attributes.|  
|**Delete**|User can delete leaf members.|  
|**Deny**|Deny all access to the leaf members.|  
  
 The Read, Create, Update, and Delete permissions can be combined. When Create, Update and Delete are assigned, the read permission is assigned automatically.  
  
## Attribute Permissions  
 Attribute permissions apply to the attributeâ€™s values for the specific entity. Users with attribute permissions only cannot add or remove members.  
  
|Permission|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**Read**|User can read attributes.|  
|**Create**|User can assign values when they create members.|  
|**Update**|User can update attributes.|  
|**Delete**|No effect.|  
|**Deny**|The attribute is not displayed.<br /><br /> Note: You cannot explicitly deny access to Name and Code attributes.|  
  
### Example  
 For the Product entity, assign **Update** permission to Subcategory attribute. Deny permission to all other attributes.  
  
|Name|Code|Subcategory (Update)|  
|----------|----------|----------------------------|  
|Mountain-100|BK-M101|{5} Mountain Bikes|  
|Mountain-100|BK-M201|{5} Mountain Bikes|  
  
 In **Explorer**, you can update any attribute value in the Subcategory column. If you do not have permission to an attribute, the attribute is not displayed.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In this example, Subcategory is a domain-based attribute, based on the SubcategoryList entity. You can select a different subcategory for Mountain-100 but you cannot add members to or delete members from the SubcategoryList entity.
