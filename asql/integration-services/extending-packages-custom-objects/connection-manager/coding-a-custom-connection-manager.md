# Coding a Custom Connection Manager
  After you have created a class that inherits from the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase> base class, and applied the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DtsConnectionAttribute> attribute to the class, you must override the implementation of the properties and methods of the base class to provide your custom functionality.  
  
 For samples of custom connection managers, see [Developing a User Interface for a Custom Connection Manager](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/connection-manager/developing-a-user-interface-for-a-custom-connection-manager.md). The code examples shown in this topic are drawn from the SQL Server Custom Connection Manager sample.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Most of the tasks, sources, and destinations that have been built into [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] work only with specific types of built-in connection managers. Therefore, these samples cannot be tested with the built-in tasks and components.  
  
## Configuring the Connection Manager  
  
### Setting the ConnectionString Property  
 The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.ConnectionString%2A> property is an important property and the only property unique to a custom connection manager. The connection manager uses the value of this property to connect to the external data source. If you are combining several other properties, such as server name and database name, to create the connection string, you can use a helper function to assemble the string by replacing certain values in a connection string template with the new value supplied by the user. The following code example shows an implementation of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.ConnectionString%2A> property that relies on a helper function to assemble the string.  
  
```vb#  
' Default values.  
Private _serverName As String = "(local)"  
Private _databaseName As String = "AdventureWorks"  
Private _connectionString As String = String.Empty  
  
Private Const CONNECTIONSTRING_TEMPLATE As String = _  
  "Data Source=<servername>;Initial Catalog=<databasename>;Integrated Security=SSPI"  
  
Public Property ServerName() As String  
  Get  
    Return _serverName  
  End Get  
  Set(ByVal value As String)  
    _serverName = value  
  End Set  
End Property  
  
Public Property DatabaseName() As String  
  Get  
    Return _databaseName  
  End Get  
  Set(ByVal value As String)  
    _databaseName = value  
  End Set  
End Property  
  
Public Overrides Property ConnectionString() As String  
  Get  
    UpdateConnectionString()  
    Return _connectionString  
  End Get  
  Set(ByVal value As String)  
    _connectionString = value  
  End Set  
End Property  
  
Private Sub UpdateConnectionString()  
  
  Dim temporaryString As String = CONNECTIONSTRING_TEMPLATE  
  
  If Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(_serverName) Then  
    temporaryString = temporaryString.Replace("<servername>", _serverName)  
  End If  
  If Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(_databaseName) Then  
    temporaryString = temporaryString.Replace("<databasename>", _databaseName)  
  End If  
  
  _connectionString = temporaryString  
  
End Sub  
```  
  
```c#  
// Default values.  
private string _serverName = "(local)";  
private string _databaseName = "AdventureWorks";  
private string _connectionString = String.Empty;  
  
private const string CONNECTIONSTRING_TEMPLATE = "Data Source=<servername>;Initial Catalog=<databasename>;Integrated Security=SSPI";  
  
public string ServerName  
{  
  get  
  {  
    return _serverName;  
  }  
  set  
  {  
    _serverName = value;  
  }  
}  
  
public string DatabaseName  
{  
  get  
  {  
    return _databaseName;  
  }  
  set  
  {  
    _databaseName = value;  
  }  
}  
  
public override string ConnectionString  
{  
  get  
  {  
    UpdateConnectionString();  
    return _connectionString;  
  }  
  set  
  {  
    _connectionString = value;  
  }  
}  
  
private void UpdateConnectionString()  
{  
  
  string temporaryString = CONNECTIONSTRING_TEMPLATE;  
  
  if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(_serverName))  
  {  
    temporaryString = temporaryString.Replace("<servername>", _serverName);  
  }  
  
  if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(_databaseName))  
  {  
    temporaryString = temporaryString.Replace("<databasename>", _databaseName);  
  }  
  
  _connectionString = temporaryString;  
  
}  
```  
  
### Validating the Connection Manager  
 You override the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.Validate%2A> method to make sure that the connection manager has been configured correctly. At a minimum, you should validate the format of the connection string and make sure that values have been provided for all arguments. Execution cannot continue until the connection manager returns <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DTSExecResult.Success> from the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.Validate%2A> method.  
  
 The following code example shows an implementation of <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.Validate%2A> that makes sure that the user has specified a server name for the connection.  
  
```vb#  
Public Overrides Function Validate(ByVal infoEvents As Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.IDTSInfoEvents) As Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DTSExecResult  
  
  If String.IsNullOrEmpty(_serverName) Then  
    infoEvents.FireError(0, "SqlConnectionManager", "No server name specified", String.Empty, 0)  
    Return DTSExecResult.Failure  
  Else  
    Return DTSExecResult.Success  
  End If  
  
End Function  
```  
  
```c#  
public override Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DTSExecResult Validate(Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.IDTSInfoEvents infoEvents)  
{  
  
  if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(_serverName))  
  {  
    infoEvents.FireError(0, "SqlConnectionManager", "No server name specified", String.Empty, 0);  
    return DTSExecResult.Failure;  
  }  
  else  
  {  
    return DTSExecResult.Success;  
  }  
  
}  
```  
  
### Persisting the Connection Manager  
 Usually, you do not have to implement custom persistence for a connection manager. Custom persistence is required only when the properties of an object use complex data types. For more information, see [Developing Custom Objects for Integration Services](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/developing-custom-objects-for-integration-services.md).  
  
## Working with the External Data Source  
 The methods that support connecting to an external data source are the most important methods of a custom connection manager. The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.AcquireConnection%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.ReleaseConnection%2A> methods are called at various times during both design time and run time.  
  
### Acquiring the Connection  
 You need to decide what type of object it is appropriate for the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.AcquireConnection%2A> method to return from your custom connection manager. For example, a File connection manager returns only a string that contains a path and filename, whereas an ADO.NET connection manager returns a managed connection object that is already open. An OLE DB connection manager returns a native OLE DB connection object that cannot be used from managed code. The custom SQL Server connection manager, from which the code snippets in this topic are taken, returns an open **SqlConnection** object.  
  
 Users of your connection manager need to know in advance what type of object to expect, so that they can cast the returned object to the appropriate type and access its methods and properties.  
  
```vb#  
Public Overrides Function AcquireConnection(ByVal txn As Object) As Object  
  
  Dim sqlConnection As New SqlConnection  
  
  UpdateConnectionString()  
  
  With sqlConnection  
    .ConnectionString = _connectionString  
    .Open()  
  End With  
  
  Return sqlConnection  
  
End Function  
```  
  
```c#  
public override object AcquireConnection(object txn)  
{  
  
  SqlConnection sqlConnection = new SqlConnection();  
  
  UpdateConnectionString();  
  
  {  
    sqlConnection.ConnectionString = _connectionString;  
    sqlConnection.Open();  
  }  
  
  return sqlConnection;  
  
}  
```  
  
### Releasing the Connection  
 The action that you take in the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.ReleaseConnection%2A> method depends on the type of object that you returned from the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.AcquireConnection%2A> method. If there is an open connection object, you should close it and to release any resources that it is using. If <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManagerBase.AcquireConnection%2A> returned only a string value, no action needs to be taken.  
  
```vb#  
Public Overrides Sub ReleaseConnection(ByVal connection As Object)  
  
  Dim sqlConnection As SqlConnection  
  
  sqlConnection = DirectCast(connection, SqlConnection)  
  
  If sqlConnection.State <> ConnectionState.Closed Then  
    sqlConnection.Close()  
  End If  
  
End Sub  
```  
  
```c#  
public override void ReleaseConnection(object connection)  
{  
  SqlConnection sqlConnection;  
  sqlConnection = (SqlConnection)connection;  
  if (sqlConnection.State != ConnectionState.Closed)  
    sqlConnection.Close();  
}  
```
