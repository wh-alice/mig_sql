# Create DML Triggers to Handle Multiple Rows of Data
  When you write the code for a DML trigger, consider that the statement that causes the trigger to fire can be a single statement that affects multiple rows of data, instead of a single row. This behavior is common for UPDATE and DELETE triggers because these statements frequently affect multiple rows. The behavior is less common for INSERT triggers because the basic INSERT statement adds only a single row. However, because an INSERT trigger can be fired by an INSERT INTO (*table_name*) SELECT statement, the insertion of many rows may cause a single trigger invocation.  
  
 Multirow considerations are especially important when the function of a DML trigger is to automatically recalculate summary values from one table and store the results in another for ongoing tallies.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  We do not recommend using cursors in triggers because they could potentially reduce performance. To design a trigger that affects multiple rows, use rowset-based logic instead of cursors.  
  
## Examples  
 The DML triggers in the following examples are designed to store a running total of a column in another table of the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../a9retired/includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample database.  
  
### A. Storing a running total for a single-row insert  
 The first version of the DML trigger works well for a single-row insert when a row of data is loaded into the `PurchaseOrderDetail` table. An INSERT statement fires the DML trigger, and the new row is loaded into the **inserted** table for the duration of the trigger execution. The `UPDATE` statement reads the `LineTotal` column value for the row and adds that value to the existing value in the `SubTotal` column in the `PurchaseOrderHeader` table. The `WHERE` clause makes sure that the updated row in the `PurchaseOrderDetail` table matches the `PurchaseOrderID` of the row in the **inserted** table.  
  
```  
-- Trigger is valid for single-row inserts.  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
CREATE TRIGGER NewPODetail  
ON Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail  
AFTER INSERT AS  
   UPDATE PurchaseOrderHeader  
   SET SubTotal = SubTotal + LineTotal  
   FROM inserted  
   WHERE PurchaseOrderHeader.PurchaseOrderID = inserted.PurchaseOrderID ;  
```  
  
### B. Storing a running total for a multirow or single-row insert  
 For a multirow insert, the DML trigger in example A might not operate correctly; the expression to the right of an assignment expression in an UPDATE statement (`SubTotal` + `LineTotal`) can be only a single value, not a list of values. Therefore, the effect of the trigger is to retrieve a value from any single row in the **inserted** table and add that value to the existing `SubTotal` value in the `PurchaseOrderHeader` table for a specific `PurchaseOrderID` value. This operation might not have the expected effect if a single `PurchaseOrderID` value occurred more than one time in the **inserted** table.  
  
 To correctly update the `PurchaseOrderHeader` table, the trigger must allow for the chance of multiple rows in the **inserted** table. You can do this by using the `SUM` function that calculates the total `LineTotal` for a group of rows in the **inserted** table for each `PurchaseOrderID`. The `SUM` function is included in a correlated subquery (the `SELECT` statement in parentheses). This subquery returns a single value for each `PurchaseOrderID` in the **inserted** table that matches or is correlated with a `PurchaseOrderID` in the `PurchaseOrderHeader` table.  
  
```  
-- Trigger is valid for multirow and single-row inserts.  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
CREATE TRIGGER NewPODetail2  
ON Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail  
AFTER INSERT AS  
   UPDATE Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader  
   SET SubTotal = SubTotal +   
      (SELECT SUM(LineTotal)  
      FROM inserted  
      WHERE PurchaseOrderHeader.PurchaseOrderID  
       = inserted.PurchaseOrderID)  
   WHERE PurchaseOrderHeader.PurchaseOrderID IN  
      (SELECT PurchaseOrderID FROM inserted);  
```  
  
 This trigger also works correctly in a single-row insert; the sum of the `LineTotal` value column is the sum of a single row. However, with this trigger the correlated subquery and the `IN` operator that is used in the `WHERE` clause require additional processing from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This is unnecessary for a single-row insert.  
  
### C. Storing a running total based on the type of insert  
 You can change the trigger to use the method optimal for the number of rows. For example, the `@@ROWCOUNT` function can be used in the logic of the trigger to distinguish between a single and a multirow insert.  
  
```  
-- Trigger valid for multirow and single row inserts  
-- and optimal for single row inserts.  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
CREATE TRIGGER NewPODetail3  
ON Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail  
FOR INSERT AS  
IF @@ROWCOUNT = 1  
BEGIN  
   UPDATE Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader  
   SET SubTotal = SubTotal + LineTotal  
   FROM inserted  
   WHERE PurchaseOrderHeader.PurchaseOrderID = inserted.PurchaseOrderID  
END  
ELSE  
BEGIN  
      UPDATE Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader  
   SET SubTotal = SubTotal +   
      (SELECT SUM(LineTotal)  
      FROM inserted  
      WHERE PurchaseOrderHeader.PurchaseOrderID  
       = inserted.PurchaseOrderID)  
   WHERE PurchaseOrderHeader.PurchaseOrderID IN  
      (SELECT PurchaseOrderID FROM inserted)  
END;  
```
