# Lesson 4: Perform a Restore From a Full Database Backup
This lesson demonstrates the use of a tsql statement to perform a restore from a full database backup created in the previous lesson.  
  
## Perform a Restore of a Database Backup  
To restore a full database backup, use the following steps:  
  
1.  Connect to [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
2.  In the **Object Explorer**, connect to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
3.  On the Standard menu bar, click **New Query**.  
  
4.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window, modify as needed.  
  
    ```  
    RESTORE DATABASE AdventureWorks2012   
    FROM URL = 'https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/privatecontainertest/AdventureWorks2012.bak'   
    WITH CREDENTIAL = 'mycredential';  
    , STATS = 5 â€“ use this to see monitor the progress  
    GO  
  
    ```  
  
5.  Verify the T-SQL statement and click **Execute**
