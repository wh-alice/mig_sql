# @@FETCH_STATUS (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns the status of the last cursor FETCH statement issued against any cursor currently opened by the connection.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
@@FETCH_STATUS  
```  
  
## Return Type  
 **integer**  
  
## Return Value  
  
|Return value|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|0|The FETCH statement was successful.|  
|-1|The FETCH statement failed or the row was beyond the result set.|  
|-2|The row fetched is missing.|
|-9|The cursor is not performing a fetch operation.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Because @@FETCH_STATUS is global to all cursors on a connection, use @@FETCH_STATUS carefully. After a FETCH statement is executed, the test for @@FETCH_STATUS must occur before any other FETCH statement is executed against another cursor. The value of @@FETCH_STATUS is undefined before any fetches have occurred on the connection.  
  
 For example, a user executes a FETCH statement from one cursor, and then calls a stored procedure that opens and processes the results from another cursor. When control is returned from the called stored procedure, @@FETCH_STATUS reflects the last FETCH executed in the stored procedure, not the FETCH statement executed before the stored procedure is called.  
  
 To retrieve the last fetch status of a specific cursor, query the **fetch_status** column of the **sys.dm_exec_cursors** dynamic management function.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses `@@FETCH_STATUS` to control cursor activities in a `WHILE` loop.  
  
```  
DECLARE Employee_Cursor CURSOR FOR  
SELECT BusinessEntityID, JobTitle  
FROM AdventureWorks2012.HumanResources.Employee;  
OPEN Employee_Cursor;  
FETCH NEXT FROM Employee_Cursor;  
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0  
   BEGIN  
      FETCH NEXT FROM Employee_Cursor;  
   END;  
CLOSE Employee_Cursor;  
DEALLOCATE Employee_Cursor;  
GO  
```
