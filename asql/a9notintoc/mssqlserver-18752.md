## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|18752|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|REPL_INUSE|  
|Message Text|Only one Log Reader Agent or log-related procedure (sp_repldone, sp_replcmds, and sp_replshowcmds) can connect to a database at a time. If you executed a log-related procedure, drop the connection over which the procedure was executed or execute sp_replflush over that connection before starting the Log Reader Agent or executing another log-related procedure.|  
  
## Explanation  
Only one Log Reader agent or log-related procedure can connect to a database at a time.  
  
## User Action  
Make sure no other logreader is running for the same publishing database, and no other active connection had previously run sp_replcmds/sp_repltrans/sp_repldone without running sp_replflush afterwards or disconnecting.
