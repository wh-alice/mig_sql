# sp_replmonitorhelpsubscription (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns current status information for subscriptions belonging to one or more publications at the Publisher and returns one row for each returned subscription. This stored procedure, which is used to monitor replication, is executed at the Distributor on the distribution database.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_replmonitorhelpsubscription [ @publisher = ] 'publisher'  
    [ , [ @publisher_db = ] 'publisher_db' ]  
    [ , [ @publication = ] 'publication' ]  
    [ , [ @publication_type = ] publication_type ]   
    [ , [ @mode = ] mode ]  
    [ , [ @topnum = ] topnum ]   
    [ , [ @exclude_anonymous = ] exclude_anonymous ]   
    [ , [ @refreshpolicy = ] refreshpolicy ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@publisher** = ] **'***publisher***'**  
 Is the name of the Publisher the status of which is being monitored. *publisher* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL. If **null**, information is returned for all Publishers that use the Distributor.  
  
 [ **@publisher_db** = ] **'***publisher_db***'**  
 Is the name of the published database. *publisher_db* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL. If NULL, then information is returned for all published databases at the Publisher.  
  
 [ **@publication** = ] **'***publication***'**  
 Is the name of the publication being monitored. *publication* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL.  
  
 [ **@publication_type** = ] *publication_type*  
 If the type of publication. *publication_type* is **int**, and can be one of these values.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**0**|Transactional publication.|  
|**1**|Snapshot publication.|  
|**2**|Merge publication.|  
|NULL (default)|Replication tries to determine the publication type.|  
  
 [ **@mode** = ] *mode*  
 Is the filtering mode to use when returning subscription monitoring information. *mode* is **int**, and can be one of these values.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**0** (default)|Returns all subscriptions.|  
|**1**|Returns only subscriptions with errors.|  
|**2**|Returns only subscriptions that have generated threshold metric warnings.|  
|**3**|Returns only subscriptions that either have errors or have generated threshold metric warnings.|  
|**4**|Returns the top 25 worst performing subscriptions.|  
|**5**|Returns the top 50 worst performing subscriptions.|  
|**6**|Returns only subscriptions that are currently being synchronized.|  
|**7**|Returns only subscriptions that are not currently being synchronized.|  
  
 [ **@topnum** = ] *topnum*  
 Restricts the result set to only the specified number of subscriptions at the top of the returned data. *topnum* is **int**, with no default.  
  
 [ **@exclude_anonymous** = ] *exclude_anonymous*  
 Is if anonymous pull subscriptions are excluded from the result set. *exclude_anonymous* is **bit**, with a default of **0**; a value of **1** means that anonymous subscriptions are excluded and a value of **0** means that they are included.  
  
 [ **@refreshpolicy=** ] *refreshpolicy*  
 Internal use only.

## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_replmonitorhelpsubscription** is used with all types of replication.  
  
 **sp_replmonitorhelpsubscription** orders the result set based on the severity of the status of the subscription, which is determined by the value of *monitorranking*. For example, rows for all subscriptions in an error state are ordered above rows for subscriptions in a warning state.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **db_owner** or **replmonitor** fixed database role on the distribution database can execute **sp_replmonitorhelpsubscription**.
