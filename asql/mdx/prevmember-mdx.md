# PrevMember (MDX)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns the previous member in the level that contains a specified member.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Member_Expression.PrevMember   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Member_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a member.  
  
## Remarks  
 The **PrevMember** function returns the previous member in the same level as the specified member.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a simple query that uses the **PrevMember** function to display the name of the member immediately before the current member on the rows axis:  
  
 `WITH MEMBER MEASURES.PREVMEMBERDEMO AS`  
  
 `[Date].[Calendar].CURRENTMEMBER.PREVMEMBER.NAME`  
  
 `SELECT MEASURES.PREVMEMBERDEMO ON 0,`  
  
 `[Date].[Calendar].MEMBERS ON 1`  
  
 `FROM [Adventure Works]`  
  
 The following example returns the count of the resellers whose sales have declined over the previous time period, based on user-selected State-Province member values evaluated using the Aggregate function. The **Hierarchize** and **DrillDownLevel** functions are used to return values for declining sales for product categories in the Product dimension. The **PrevMember** function is used to compare the current time period with the previous time period.  
  
```  
WITH MEMBER Measures.[Declining Reseller Sales] AS   
   Count(  
      Filter(  
         Existing(Reseller.Reseller.Reseller),   
            [Measures].[Reseller Sales Amount] < ([Measures].[Reseller Sales Amount],  
            [Date].Calendar.PrevMember)  
            )  
         )  
MEMBER [Geography].[State-Province].x AS   
   Aggregate (   
      {[Geography].[State-Province].&[WA]&[US],   
      [Geography].[State-Province].&[OR]&[US] }   
         )  
SELECT NON EMPTY Hierarchize (  
   AddCalculatedMembers (  
      {DrillDownLevel({[Product].[All Products]})}  
         )  
   )  
        DIMENSION PROPERTIES PARENT_UNIQUE_NAME ON COLUMNS   
FROM [Adventure Works]  
WHERE ([Geography].[State-Province].x,   
    [Date].[Calendar].[Calendar Quarter].&[2003]&[4],  
    [Measures].[Declining Reseller Sales])  
```
