  The **IHpublications** system table contains one row for each non-SQL Server publication using the current Distributor. This table is stored in the distribution database.

|**name**|**sysname**|The unique name associated with the publication.|  
|**repl_freq**|**tinyint**|The replication frequency:<br /><br /> **0** = Transaction based.<br /><br /> **1** = Scheduled table refresh.|  
|**status**|**tinyint**|The status of the publication, which can be one of the following.<br /><br /> **0** = Inactive.<br /><br /> **1** = Active.|  
|**sync_method**|**tinyint**|The synchronization method:<br /><br /> **1** = Character bulk copy.<br /><br /> **4** = Concurrent_c, which means that character bulk copy is used but tables are not locked during the snapshot.|

|**immediate_sync_ready**|**bit**|Indicates whether the synchronization files are available, where **1** means that they are available. *Not supported for non-SQL Publishers.*|  
|**allow_queued_tran**|**bit**|Specifies whether queuing of changes at the Subscriber until they can be applied at the Publisher has been enabled. If **1**, changes at the Subscriber are queued. *Not supported for non-SQL Publishers.*|  
|**allow_sync_tran**|**bit**|Specifies whether immediate-updating subscriptions are allowed on the publication. **1** means that immediate-updating subscriptions are allowed. *Not supported for non-SQL Publishers.*|  
|**autogen_sync_procs**|**bit**|Specifies whether the synchronizing stored procedure for immediate-updating subscriptions is generated at the Publisher. **1** means that it is generated at the Publisher. *Not supported for non-SQL Publishers.*|  
|**snapshot_in_defaultfolder**|**bit**|Specifies whether snapshot files are stored in the default folder. If **0**, snapshot files have been stored in the alternate location specified by *alternate_snapshot_folder*. If **1**, snapshot files can be found in the default folder.|  
|**alt_snapshot_folder**|**nvarchar(510)**|Specifies the location of the alternate folder for the snapshot.|  
|**pre_snapshot_script**|**nvarchar(510)**|Specifies a pointer to a **.sql** file location. The Distribution Agent runs the pre-snapshot script before running any of the replicated object scripts when applying a snapshot at a Subscriber.|  
|**post_snapshot_script**|**nvarchar(510)**|Specifies a pointer to a **.sql** file location. The Distribution Agent runs the post-snapshot script after all the other replicated object scripts and data have been applied during an initial synchronization.|  
|**compress_snapshot**|**bit**|Specifies that the snapshot that is written to the *alt_snapshot_folder* location is to be compressed into the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] CAB format. **0** specifies that the snapshot will not be compressed.|  
|**ftp_address**|**sysname**|The network address of the FTP service for the Distributor. Specifies where publication snapshot files are located for the Distribution Agent to pick up.|  
|**ftp_port**|**int**|The port number of the FTP service for the Distributor. Specifies where the publication snapshot files are located for the Distribution Agent to pick up|  
|**ftp_subdirectory**|**nvarchar(510)**|Specifies where the snapshot files are available for the Distribution Agent to pick up if the publication supports propagating snapshots using FTP.|  
|**ftp_login**|**nvarchar(256)**|The username used to connect to the FTP service.|  
|**ftp_password**|**nvarchar(1048)**|The user password used to connect to the FTP service.|

|**allow_anonymous**|**bit**|Indicates whether anonymous subscriptions are allowed on the publication, where **1** means that they are allowed.|  
|**centralized_conflicts**|**bit**|Specifies whether conflict records are stored on the Publisher:<br /><br /> **0** = Conflict records are stored at both the publisher and at the subscriber that caused the conflict.<br /><br /> **1** = Conflict records are stored at the Publisher.<br /><br /> *Not supported for non-SQL Publishers.*|  
|**conflict_retention**|**int**|Specifies the conflict retention period, in days. *Not supported for non-SQL Publishers.*|  
|**conflict_policy**|**int**|Specifies the conflict resolution policy followed when the queued updating subscriber option is used. Can be one of these values:<br /><br /> **1** = Publisher wins the conflict.<br /><br /> **2** = Subscriber wins the conflict.<br /><br /> **3** = Subscription is reinitialized.<br /><br /> *Not supported for non-SQL Publishers.*|  
|**queue_type**|**int**|Specifies which type of queue is used. Can be one of these values:<br /><br /> **1** = msmq, which uses [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Message Queuing to store transactions.<br /><br /> **2** = sql, which uses [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to store transactions.<br /><br /> This column is not used by non-[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Publishers.<br /><br /> Note: Using [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Message Queuing has been deprecated and is no longer supported.<br /><br /> *This column is not supported for non-SQL Publishers.*|  
|**ad_guidname**|**sysname**|Specifies whether the publication is published in the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Active Directory. A valid globally unique identifier (GUID) specifies that the publication is published in the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Active Directory, and the GUID is the corresponding Active Directory publication object **objectGUID**.

|**allow_subscription_copy**|**bit**|Specifies whether the ability to copy the subscription databases that subscribe to this publication has been enabled. **1** means that copying is allowed.|  
|**allow_initialize_from_backup**|**bit**|Indicates if Subscribers can initialize a subscription to this publication from a backup rather than an initial snapshot. **1** means that subscriptions can be initialized from a backup, and **0** means that they cannot. For more information, see [Initialize a Transactional Subscription Without a Snapshot](../../../relational-databases/replication/initialize-a-transactional-subscription-without-a-snapshot.md). *Not supported for non-SQL Publishers.*|
