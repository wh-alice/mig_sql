# Audit Schema Object GDR Event Class
  The **Audit Schema Object GDR** event class occurs whenever a GRANT, REVOKE, or DENY is issued for a schema object permission by any user in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Audit Schema Object GDR Event Class Data Columns  
  
|Data column name|Data type|Description|Column ID|Filterable|  
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|  
|**ApplicationName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the client application that created the connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This column is populated with the values passed by the application rather than the displayed name of the program.|10|Yes|  
|**ClientProcessID**|**int**|ID assigned by the host computer to the process where the client application is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the client process ID.|9|Yes|  
|**ColumnPermissions**|**int**|Indicator of whether a column permission was set. Parse the statement text to determine exactly which permissions were applied to which columns. 1=Yes, 0=No.|44|Yes|  
|**DatabaseID**|**int**|ID of the database specified by the USE *database* statement or the default database if no USE *database* statement has been issued for a given instance. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the **ServerName** data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|  
|**DatabaseName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the database in which the user statement is running.|35|Yes|  
|**DBUserName**|**nvarchar**|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] user name of the client.|40|Yes|  
|**EventClass**|**int**|Type of event = 103.|27|No|  
|**EventSequence**|**int**|Sequence of a given event within the request.|51|No|  
|**EventSubClass**|**int**|Type of event subclass.<br /><br /> 1=Grant<br /><br /> 2=Revoke<br /><br /> 3=Deny|21|Yes|  
|**HostName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the computer on which the client is running. This data column is populated if the host name is provided by the client. To determine the host name, use the HOST_NAME function.|8|Yes|  
|**IsSystem**|**int**|Indicates whether the event occurred on a system process or a user process. 1 = system, 0 = user.|60|Yes|  
|**LoginName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the login of the user (either the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security login or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows login credentials in the form of DOMAIN\username).|11|Yes|  
|**LoginSid**|**image**|Security identification number (SID) of the logged-in user. You can find this information in the **sys.server_principals** catalog view. Each SID is unique for each login in the server.|41|Yes|  
|**NTDomainName**|**nvarchar**|Windows domain to which the user belongs.|7|Yes|  
|**NTUserName**|**nvarchar**|Windows user name.|6|Yes|  
|**ObjectName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the object that is the target of the grant/revoke/deny.|34|Yes|  
|**ObjectType**|**int**|Value representing the type of the object involved in the event. This value corresponds to the type column in the **sys.objects** catalog view. For values, see [ObjectType Trace Event Column](../../relational-databases/event-classes/objecttype-trace-event-column.md).|28|Yes|  
|**OwnerName**|**nvarchar**|Database username of the object owner of the object being targeted in the grant/revoke/deny.|37|Yes|  
|**ParentName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the schema the object is within.|59|Yes|  
|**Permissions**|**bigint**|Integer value representing the type of permissions checked.<br /><br /> 1=SELECT ALL<br /><br /> 2=UPDATE ALL<br /><br /> 4=REFERENCES ALL<br /><br /> 8=INSERT<br /><br /> 16=DELETE<br /><br /> 32=EXECUTE (procedures only)<br /><br /> 4096=SELECT ANY (at least one column)<br /><br /> 8192=UPDATE ANY<br /><br /> 16384=REFERENCES ANY|19|Yes|  
|**RequestID**|**int**|ID of the request containing the statement.|49|Yes|  
|**ServerName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] being traced.|26|No|  
|**SessionLoginName**|**nvarchar**|Login name of the user who originated the session. For example, if you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using Login1 and execute a statement as Login2, **SessionLoginName** shows Login1 and **LoginName** shows Login2. This column displays both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows logins.|64|Yes|  
|**SPID**|**int**|ID of the session on which the event occurred.|12|Yes|  
|**StartTime**|**datetime**|Time at which the event started, if available.|14|Yes|  
|**Success**|**int**|1 = success. 0 = failure. For example, a value of 1 indicates success of a permissions check and a value of 0 indicates failure of that check.|23|Yes|  
|**TargetLoginName**|**nvarchar**|For actions that target a login (for example, adding a new login), the name of the targeted login.|42|Yes|  
|**TargetLoginSid**|**image**|For actions that target a login (for example, adding a new login), the security identification number (SID) of the targeted login.|43|Yes|  
|**TargetUserName**|**nvarchar**|For actions that target a database user (for example, granting permission to a user), the name of that user.|39|Yes|  
|**TextData**|**ntext**|Text value dependent on the event class captured in the trace.|1|Yes|  
|**TransactionID**|**bigint**|System-assigned ID of the transaction.|4|Yes|  
|**XactSequence**|**bigint**|Token used to describe the current transaction.|50|Yes|
