# Developing a Custom Data Flow Component
  The data flow task consists of components that connect to a variety of data sources and then transform and route that data at high speed. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] provides an extensible object model that lets developers create custom sources, transformations, and destinations that you can use in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] and in deployed packages. This section contains topics that will guide you in developing custom data flow components.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Creating a Custom Data Flow Component](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/creating-a-custom-data-flow-component.md)  
 Describes the initial steps in creating a custom data flow component.  
  
 [Design-time Methods of a Data Flow Component](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/design-time-methods-of-a-data-flow-component.md)  
 Describes the design-time methods to implement in a custom data flow component.  
  
 [Run-time Methods of a Data Flow Component](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/run-time-methods-of-a-data-flow-component.md)  
 Describes the run-time methods to implement in a custom data flow component.  
  
 [Execution Plan and Buffer Allocation](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/execution-plan-and-buffer-allocation.md)  
 Describes the data flow execution plan and the allocation of data buffers.  
  
 [Working with Data Types in the Data Flow](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/working-with-data-types-in-the-data-flow.md)  
 Explains how the data flow maps [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] data types to .NET Framework managed data types.  
  
 [Validating a Data Flow Component](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/validating-a-data-flow-component.md)  
 Explains the methods used to validate component configuration and to reconfigure component metadata.  
  
 [Implementing External Metadata](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/implementing-external-metadata.md)  
 Explains how to use external metadata columns for data validation.  
  
 [Raising and Defining Events in a Data Flow Component](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/raising-and-defining-events-in-a-data-flow-component.md)  
 Explains how to raise predefined and custom events.  
  
 [Logging and Defining Log Entries in a Data Flow Component](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/logging-and-defining-log-entries-in-a-data-flow-component.md)  
 Explains how to create and write to custom log entries.  
  
 [Using Error Outputs in a Data Flow Component](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/using-error-outputs-in-a-data-flow-component.md)  
 Explains how to redirect error rows to an alternative output.  
  
 [Upgrading the Version of a Data Flow Component](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/upgrading-the-version-of-a-data-flow-component.md)  
 Explains how to update saved component metadata when a new version of your component is first used.  
  
 [Developing a User Interface for a Data Flow Component](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/developing-a-user-interface-for-a-data-flow-component.md)  
 Explains how to implement a custom editor for a component.  
  
 [Developing Specific Types of Data Flow Components](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects-data-flow-types/developing-specific-types-of-data-flow-components.md)  
 Contains information about developing the three types of data flow components: sources, transformations, and destinations.  
  
## Reference
