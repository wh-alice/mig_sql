# sys.numbered_procedures (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-asdw-pdw_md](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

  Contains a row for each SQL Server stored procedure that was created as a numbered procedure. This does not show a row for the base (number = 1) stored procedure. Entries for the base stored procedures can be found in views such as **sys.objects** and **sys.procedures**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Numbered procedures are deprecated. Use of numbered procedures is discouraged. A DEPRECATION_ANNOUNCEMENT event is fired when a query that uses this catalog view is compiled.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**object_id**|**int**|ID of the object of the stored procedure.|  
|**procedure_number**|**smallint**|Number of this procedure within the object, 2 or greater.|  
|**definition**|**nvarchar(max)**|The SQL Server text that defines this procedure.<br /><br /> NULL = encrypted.|  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  XML and CLR parameters are not supported for numbered procedures.
