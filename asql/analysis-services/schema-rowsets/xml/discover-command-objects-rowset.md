## Using ADOMD.NET to return the rowset  
 When using ADOMD.NET and the schema rowset to retrieve metadata, you can use either the GUID or string to reference a schema rowset object in the GetSchemaDataSet method. For more information, see [Working with Schema Rowsets in ADOMD.NET](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models-adomd-net-client/retrieving-metadata-working-with-schema-rowsets.md).  
  
 The following table provides the GUID and string values that identify this rowset.  
  
|Argument|Value|  
|--------------|-----------|  
|GUID|a07ccd35-8148-11d0-87bb-00c04fc33942|  
|ADOMDNAME|CommandObjects|
