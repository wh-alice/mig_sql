# Divide (SSIS Expression)
  Divides the first numeric expression by the second one.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
dividend / divisor  
  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *dividend*  
 Is the numeric expression to divide. *dividend* can be any valid numeric expression. For more information, see [Integration Services Data Types](../../integration-services/data-flow/integration-services-data-types.md).  
  
 *divisor*  
 Is the numeric expression to divide the dividend by. *divisor* can be any valid numeric expression except zero.  
  
## Result Types  
 Determined by data types of the two arguments. For more information, see [Integration Services Data Types in Expressions](../../integration-services/expressions/integration-services-data-types-in-expressions.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 If either operand is null, the result is null.  
  
 Dividing by zero is not legal. Depending on how the *divisor* subexpression is evaluated, one of following errors occurs:  
  
-   If the *divisor* subexpression that evaluates to zero is a constant, the error appears at design time, causing the expression to fail validation.  
  
-   If the *divisor* subexpression that evaluates to zero contains variables, but no input columns, the component to which the expression belongs fails the pre-execution validation that occurs before the package runs.  
  
-   If the *divisor* subexpression that evaluates to zero contains input columns, the error appears at run time and is handled according to the error flow rules of the data flow component.  
  
## Expression Examples  
 This example divides two numeric literals.  
  
```  
25 / 5  
```  
  
 This example divides values in the **ListPrice** column by values in the **StandardCost** column.  
  
```  
ListPrice / StandardCost  
```
