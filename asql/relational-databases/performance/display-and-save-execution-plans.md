# Display and Save Execution Plans
  This section explains how to display execution plans and how to save execution plans to a file in XML format by using Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 Execution plans graphically display the data retrieval methods chosen by the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] query optimizer. Execution plans represent the execution cost of specific statements and queries in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using icons rather than the tabular representation produced by the SET SHOWPLAN_ALL or SET SHOWPLAN_TEXT statements. This graphical approach is very useful for understanding the performance characteristics of a query.
