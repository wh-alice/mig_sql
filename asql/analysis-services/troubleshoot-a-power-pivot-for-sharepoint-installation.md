# Troubleshoot a Power Pivot for SharePoint Installation
  If you get errors instead of the pages and features you expect, do the following.  
  
-   Review release notes for both SharePoint and [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] to get workarounds for known installation problems. Release notes are provided with the installation media or on the Microsoft site from which you downloaded the software.  
  
    -   [SQL Server 2016 Release Notes](../sql-server/sql-server-2016-release-notes.md)  
  
-   See the TechNet wiki topic, [Troubleshooting Installations of Power Pivot (and other add-ins)](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13737.troubleshooting-installations-of-powerpivot-and-other-add-ins.aspx).  
  
## Issues  
  
### Power Pivot Gallery Thumbnail images show as a red X  
 One Possible cause is the **[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] features Integration for Site Collections** is not active. Complete the following:  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Gallery library, click **Site Settings** from either the gear icon ![SharePoint Settings](../a9retired/media/as-sharepoint2013-settings-gear.gif "SharePoint Settings") or the **Home** list.  
  
2.  In the **Site Collection Administration** section, click **Site Collection Features**.  
  
3.  Click **Site Collection Features**.  
  
4.  Verify **[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] features Integration for Site Collections** is **Active**.
