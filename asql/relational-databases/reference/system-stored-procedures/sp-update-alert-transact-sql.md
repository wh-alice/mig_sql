 [ **@message_id =**] *message_id*  
 A new message or error number for the alert definition. Typically, *message_id* corresponds to an error number in the **sysmessages** table. *message_id* is **int**, with a default of NULL. A message ID can be used only if the severity level setting for the alert is **0**.  
  
 [ **@severity =**] *severity*

Any [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] message sent to the Windows application log with the specified severity will activate the alert. *severity* is **int**, with a default of NULL. A severity level can be used only if the message ID setting for the alert is **0**.

## Permissions  
 To run this stored procedure, users must be a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role.
