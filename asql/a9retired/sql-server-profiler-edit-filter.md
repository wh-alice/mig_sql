# SQL Server Profiler - Edit Filter
  Use the **Edit Filter** dialog box to create and modify data column filters in a trace. Click a data column name in the list and the filter criteria that is available for that data column displays in the adjacent pane. Enter the filter criteria and click **OK** to apply it to the selected data column. If a filter icon appears to the left of the data column name in the list, that column already has a filter configured for it.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For string type data columns, the filter criteria will show as a LIKE or NOT LIKE string value.
