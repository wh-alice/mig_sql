# Select the Report Type
  Use this page of the Report Wizard to select either a tabular report or a matrix report.  
  
## Options  
 **Tabular**  
 Create a report that contains a table. A table is a data region in which data is arranged into columns and rows. Tables have a static set of columns, and the number of rows in the table depends on the data in the dataset.  
  
 Subsequent pages in the wizard provide options for defining the table.  
  
 **Matrix**  
 Create a report that contains a matrix. A matrix is a data region in which data is arranged into columns and rows. Matrices provide functionality similar to crosstabs and pivot tables. Unlike a table, which has a static set of columns, matrix columns can be dynamic.  
  
 Subsequent pages in the wizard provide options for defining the matrix.
