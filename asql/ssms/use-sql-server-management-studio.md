# Use SQL Server Management Studio
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. SSMS combines a broad group of graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide access to SQL Server to developers and administrators of all skill levels.  
  
SSMS combines the features of Enterprise Manager, Query Analyzer, and Analysis Manager, included in previous releases of SQL Server, into a single environment. In addition, SSMS works with all components of SQL Server such as Reporting Services and Integration Services. Developers get a familiar experience, and database administrators get a single comprehensive utility that combines easy-to-use graphical tools with rich scripting capabilities.  
  
To get the latest version, see [Download SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx).
