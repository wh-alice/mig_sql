# Maintaining an Always On Publication Database (SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This topic discusses special considerations for maintaining a publication database when you use Always On availability groups.

##  <a name="MaintainPublDb"></a> Maintaining a Published Database in an Availability Group  
 Maintaining an Always On publication database is basically the same as maintaining a standard publication database, with the following considerations:  
  
-   Administration must occur at the primary replica host. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], publications appear under the **Local Publications** folder for the primary replica host and also for readable secondary replicas. After failover, you might have to manually refresh [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] for the change to be reflected if the secondary that was promoted to primary was not readable.  
  
-   Replication Monitor always displays publication information under the original publisher. However, this information can be viewed in Replication Monitor from any replica by adding the original publisher as a server.  
  
-   When using stored procedures or Replication Management Objects (RMO) to administer replication at the current primary, for cases in which you specify the Publisher name, you must specify the name of the instance on which the database was enabled for replication (the original publisher). To determine the appropriate name, use the **PUBLISHINGSERVERNAME** function. When a publishing database joins an availability group, the replication metadata stored in the secondary database replicas is identical to that at the primary. Consequently, for publication databases enabled for replication at the primary, the publisher instance name stored in system tables at the secondary is the name of the primary, not the secondary. This affects replication configuration and maintenance if the publication database fails over to a secondary. For example, if you are configuring replication with stored procedures at a secondary after failover, and you want a pull subscription to a publication database that was enabled at a different replica, you must specify the name of the original publisher instead of the current publisher as the *@publisher* parameter of **sp_addpullsubscription** or **sp_addmergepulllsubscription**. However, if you enable a publication database after failover, the publisher instance name stored in the system tables is the name of the current primary host. In this case, you would use the host name of the current primary replica for the *@publisher* parameter.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  For some procedures, such as **sp_addpublication**, the *@publisher* parameter is supported only for publishers that are not instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]; in these cases, it is not relevant for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Always On.  
  
-   To synchronize a subscription in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] after a failover, synchronize pull subscriptions from the subscriber and synchronize push subscriptions from the active publisher.  
  
##  <a name="RemovePublDb"></a> Removing a Published Database from an Availability Group  
 Consider the following issues if a published database is removed from an availability group, or if an availability group that has a published member database is dropped.  
  
-   If the publication database at the original publisher is removed from an availability group primary replica, you must run **sp_redirect_publisher** without specifying a value for the *@redirected_publisher* parameter in order to remove the redirection for the publisher/database pair.  
  
    ```  
    EXEC sys.sp_redirect_publisher   
        @original_publisher = 'MyPublisher',  
        @published_database = 'MyPublishedDB';  
    ```  
  
     The database will be left in the recovering state at the primary and must be restored. Once you do this, replication should work unchanged against the original Publisher.  
  
-   If the publication database fails over from the original publisher to a replica and the database is removed from the availability group primary replica, use the stored procedure **sp_redirect_publisher** to explicitly redirect the original publisher to the new publisher. The database will be left in the recovering state and must be restored. Once you do this, replication should continue to work as it did under the availability group.  
  
    ```  
    EXEC sys.sp_redirect_publisher   
        @original_publisher = 'MyPublisher',  
        @published_database = 'MyPublishedDB',  
        @redirected_publisher = 'MyNewPublisher';  
    ```  
  
     Do not remove the remote server for the original publisher from the distributor, even if the server can no longer be accessed. The server metadata for the original publisher is needed at the distributor to satisfy publication metadata queries.  
  
-   If a complete availability group is removed, the behavior with regard to a member replicated database is the same as when a published database is removed from an availability group. Replication can be resumed from the last primary as soon as the database has been restored and the redirection has been modified. If the database is restored at its original publisher, redirection should be removed. If the database is restored at a different host, redirection should be explicitly directed to the new host.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When an availability group is removed that has published member databases, or a published database is removed from an availability group, all copies of the published databases will be left in the recovering state. If restored, each will appear as a published database. Only one copy should be retained with publication metadata. To disable replication for a published database copy, first remove all subscriptions and publications from the database.  
  
     Run **sp_dropsubscription** to remove publication subscriptions. Make sure to set the parameter *@ignore_distributributor* to 1 to preserve the metadata for the active publishing database at the distributor.  
  
    ```  
    USE MyDBName;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC sys.sp_dropsubscription   
        @subscriber = 'MySubscriber',  
        @publication = 'MyPublication',  
        @article = 'all',  
        @ignore_distributor = 1;  
    ```  
  
     Run **sp_droppublication** to remove all publications. Again, set the parameter *@ignore_distributor* to 1 to preserve the metadata for the active publishing database at the distributor.  
  
    ```  
    EXEC sys.sp_droppublication   
        @publication = 'MyPublication',  
        @ignore_distributor = 1;  
    ```  
  
     Run **sp_replicationdboption** to disable replication for the database.  
  
    ```  
    EXEC sys.sp_replicationdboption  
        @dbname = 'MyDBName',  
        @optname = 'publish',  
        @value = 'false';  
    ```  
  
     At this point, the copy of the published database can be retained or dropped.
