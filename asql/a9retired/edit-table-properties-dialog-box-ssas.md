# Edit Table Properties Dialog Box (SSAS)
  The **Edit Table Properties** dialog box enables you to view and modify the properties of tables that are imported into the model designer by using the Table Import Wizard. To access this dialog box, in the model designer, select a table, then click the **Table** menu, and then click **Table Properties**.  
  
## UIElement List  
 The options for this dialog box are different depending on whether you originally imported data by selecting tables from a list or by using a SQL query.  
  
## Table Preview Mode  
 **Table name**  
 Displays the name of the data table in the model.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot edit the name here. However, you can change the name of the table by right-clicking the table tab at the bottom of the model designer.  
  
 **Connection name**  
 Displays the name of the connection that is currently in use.  
  
 **Source name**  
 Display or change the table from which the data is obtained.  
  
 If you change the source to a table that has different columns than the current table, a message is displayed warning that the columns are different. You must then select the columns that you want to put in the current table and click **Save**. You can replace the entire table by selecting the check box at the left of the table.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When you change the data source of a table, you essentially replace the contents of the current table with the contents of the new source table.
