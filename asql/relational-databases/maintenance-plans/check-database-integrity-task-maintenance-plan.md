# Check Database Integrity Task (Maintenance Plan)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Use the **Check Database Integrity Task** dialog to check the allocation and structural integrity of user and system tables, and indexes in the database, by running the `DBCC CHECKDB`[!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement. Running `DBCC` ensures that any integrity problems with the database are reported, thereby allowing them to be addressed later by a system administrator or database owner.  
  
## Options  
 **Connection**  
 Select the server connection to use when performing this task.  
  
 **New**  
 Create a new server connection to use when performing this task. The **New Connection** dialog box is described below.  
  
 **Databases**  
 Specify the databases affected by this task.  
  
-   **All databases**  
  
     Generate a maintenance plan that runs maintenance tasks against all [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases except **tempdb**.  
  
-   **All system databases**  
  
     Generate a maintenance plan that runs maintenance tasks against each of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system databases except **tempdb**. No maintenance tasks are run against user-created databases.  
  
-   **All user databases**  
  
     Generate a maintenance plan that runs maintenance tasks against all user-created databases. No maintenance tasks are run against the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system databases.  
  
-   **These specific databases**  
  
     Generate a maintenance plan that runs maintenance tasks against only those databases that are selected. At least one database in the list must be selected if this option is chosen.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Maintenance plans only run against databases set to compatibility level 80 or higher. Databases set to compatibility level 70 or lower are not displayed.  
  
 **Include indexes**  
 Check the integrity of all the index pages as well as the table data pages.  
  
 **Physical only**  
 Limits the check to the integrity of the physical structure of the page, record headers, and the allocation consistency of the database. Using this option may reduce run-time for DBCC CHECKDB on large databases, and is recommended for frequent use on production systems.  
  
 **Tablock**  
 Causes DBCC CHECKDB to obtain locks instead of using an internal database snapshot. This includes a short-term exclusive (X) lock on the database. Using this option may help DBCC CHECKDB run faster on a database under heavy load, but decreases the concurrency available on the database while DBCC CHECKDB is running.  
  
 **View T-SQL**  
 View the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements performed against the server for this task, based on the selected options.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When the number of objects affected is large, this display can take a considerable amount of time.  
  
## New Connection Dialog Box  
 **Connection name**  
 Enter a name for the new connection.  
  
 **Select or enter a server name**  
 Select a server to connect to when performing this task.  
  
 **Refresh**  
 Refresh the list of available servers.  
  
 **Enter information to log on to the server**  
 Specify how to authenticate against the server.  
  
 **Use Windows integrated security**  
 Connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] with Windows Authentication.  
  
 **Use a specific user name and password**  
 Connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication. This option is not available.  
  
 **User name**  
 Provide a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login to use when authenticating. This option is not available.  
  
 **Password**  
 Provide a password to use when authenticating. This option is not available.
