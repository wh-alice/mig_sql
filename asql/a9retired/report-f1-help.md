# Report F1 Help
  Topics in this section provide information about the options that you can set on report in the **Report Properties** dialog box. To open the **Report Properties** dialog box, you right-click the background in Report Designer, and then click **Report Properties**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  It is easy to mistake the report body for the report. The report body is the report element that contains the report content. The report includes the report body and optionally, a report header and footer. If you right-click the report body, you cannot access or set report properties.  
  
 To access these topics from within the **Report Properties** dialog box, click **Help**.
