Alternate locations can be on another server, on a network drive, or on a removable media (such as CD-ROM or removable disks). You can also save the snapshot files to a FTP site, for retrieval by the Subscriber at a later time.<br /><br /> Note: This parameter can be true and still have a location in the **alt_snapshot_folder** parameter.

A value of **0** means that synchronization is not optimized, and the partitions sent to all Subscribers are verified when data changes in a partition.<br /><br /> **1** means that synchronization is optimized, and only Subscribers having rows in the changed partition are affected.<br /><br /> Note: By default, merge publications use precomputed partitions, which provides a greater degree of optimization than this option. For more information, see [Parameterized Row Filters](../../../relational-databases/replication/merge/parameterized-filters-parameterized-row-filters.md) and [Optimize Parameterized Filter Performance with Precomputed Partitions](../../../relational-databases/replication/merge/parameterized-filters-optimize-for-precomputed-partitions.md).|
