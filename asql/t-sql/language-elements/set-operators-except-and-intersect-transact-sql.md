# Set Operators - EXCEPT and INTERSECT (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns distinct rows by comparing the results of two queries.  
  
 EXCEPT returns distinct rows from the left input query that arenâ€™t output by the right input query.  
  
 INTERSECT returns distinct rows that are output by both the left and right input queries operator.  
  
 The basic rules for combining the result sets of two queries that use EXCEPT or INTERSECT are the following:  
  
-   The number and the order of the columns must be the same in all queries.  
  
-   The data types must be compatible.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
-- Syntax for SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
{ <query_specification> | ( <query_expression> ) }   
{ EXCEPT | INTERSECT }  
{ <query_specification> | ( <query_expression> ) }  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 \<*query_specification*> | ( \<*query_expression*> )  
 Is a query specification or query expression that returns data to be compared with the data from another query specification or query expression. The definitions of the columns that are part of an EXCEPT or INTERSECT operation do not have to be the same, but they must be comparable through implicit conversion. When data types differ, the type that is used to perform the comparison and return results is determined based on the rules for [data type precedence](../../t-sql/data-types/data-type-precedence-transact-sql.md).  
  
 When the types are the same but differ in precision, scale, or length, the result is determined based on the same rules for combining expressions. For more information, see [Precision, Scale, and Length &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/data-types/precision-scale-and-length-transact-sql.md).  
  
 The query specification or expression cannot return **xml**, **text**, **ntext**, **image**, or nonbinary CLR user-defined type columns because these data types are not comparable.  
  
 EXCEPT  
 Returns any distinct values from the query to the left of the EXCEPT operator that are not also returned from the right query.  
  
 INTERSECT  
 Returns any distinct values that are returned by both the query on the left and right sides of the INTERSECT operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 When the data types of comparable columns that are returned by the queries to the left and right of the EXCEPT or INTERSECT operators are character data types with different collations, the required comparison is performed according to the rules of [collation precedence](../../t-sql/statements/collation-precedence-transact-sql.md). If this conversion cannot be performed, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] returns an error.  
  
 When comparing column values for determining DISTINCT rows, two NULL values are considered equal.  
  
 The column names of the result set that are returned by EXCEPT or INTERSECT are the same names as those returned by the query on the left side of the operator.  
  
 Column names or aliases in ORDER BY clauses must reference column names returned by the left-side query.  
  
 The nullability of any column in the result set returned by EXCEPT or INTERSECT is the same as the nullability of the corresponding column that is returned by the query on the left side of the operator.  
  
 If EXCEPT or INTERSECT is used together with other operators in an expression, it is evaluated in the context of the following precedence:  
  
1.  Expressions in parentheses  
  
2.  The INTERSECT operator  
  
3.  EXCEPT and UNION evaluated from left to right based on their position in the expression  
  
 If EXCEPT or INTERSECT is used to compare more than two sets of queries, data type conversion is determined by comparing two queries at a time, and following the previously mentioned rules of expression evaluation.  
  
 EXCEPT and INTERSECT cannot be used in distributed partitioned view definitions, query notifications.  
  
 EXCEPT and INTERSECT may be used in distributed queries, but are only executed on the local server and not pushed to the linked server. Therefore, using EXCEPT and INTERSECT in distributed queries may affect performance.  
  
 Fast forward-only and static cursors are fully supported in the result set when they are used with an EXCEPT or INTERSECT operation. If a keyset-driven or dynamic cursor is used together with an EXCEPT or INTERSECT operation, the cursor of the result set of the operation is converted to a static cursor.  
  
 When an EXCEPT operation is displayed by using the Graphical Showplan feature in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], the operation appears as a [left anti semi join](../../relational-databases/showplan-logical-and-physical-operators-reference.md), and an INTERSECT operation appears as a [left semi join](../../relational-databases/showplan-logical-and-physical-operators-reference.md).  
  
## Examples  
 The following examples show using the `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` operators. The first query returns all values from the `Production.Product` table for comparison to the results with `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT`.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT ProductID   
FROM Production.Product ;  
--Result: 504 Rows  
```  
  
 The following query returns any distinct values that are returned by both the query on the left and right sides of the `INTERSECT` operator.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT ProductID   
FROM Production.Product  
INTERSECT  
SELECT ProductID   
FROM Production.WorkOrder ;  
--Result: 238 Rows (products that have work orders)  
```  
  
 The following query returns any distinct values from the query to the left of the `EXCEPT` operator that are not also found on the right query.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT ProductID   
FROM Production.Product  
EXCEPT  
SELECT ProductID   
FROM Production.WorkOrder ;  
--Result: 266 Rows (products without work orders)  
```  
  
 The following query returns any distinct values from the query to the left of the `EXCEPT` operator that are not also found on the right query. The tables are reversed from the previous example.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT ProductID   
FROM Production.WorkOrder  
EXCEPT  
SELECT ProductID   
FROM Production.Product ;  
--Result: 0 Rows (work orders without products)  
```  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
 The following examples show how to use the `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` operators. The first query returns all values from the `FactInternetSales` table for comparison to the results with `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT`.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT CustomerKey   
FROM FactInternetSales;  
--Result: 60398 Rows  
```  
  
 The following query returns any distinct values that are returned by both the query on the left and right sides of the `INTERSECT` operator.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT CustomerKey   
FROM FactInternetSales    
INTERSECT   
SELECT CustomerKey   
FROM DimCustomer   
WHERE DimCustomer.Gender = 'F'  
ORDER BY CustomerKey;  
--Result: 9133 Rows (Sales to customers that are female.)  
```  
  
 The following query returns any distinct values from the query to the left of the `EXCEPT` operator that are not also found on the right query.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT CustomerKey   
FROM FactInternetSales    
EXCEPT   
SELECT CustomerKey   
FROM DimCustomer   
WHERE DimCustomer.Gender = 'F'  
ORDER BY CustomerKey;  
--Result: 9351 Rows (Sales to customers that are not female.)  
```
