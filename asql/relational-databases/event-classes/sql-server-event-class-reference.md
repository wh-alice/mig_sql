# SQL Server Event Class Reference
  [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] lets you record events as they occur in an instance of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. The recorded events are instances of the event classes in the trace definition. In [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)], event classes and their event categories are available on the **Events Selection** tab of the **Trace File Properties** dialog box.  
  
 The following table describes the event categories and lists their associated event classes.
