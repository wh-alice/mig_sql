# Failover Cluster Instance Administration and Maintenance
  Maintenance tasks like adding or removing nodes from an existing Always On Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) are accomplished using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup program. Other administration tasks like changing the IP address resource, recovering from certain FCI scenarios are accomplished using the Failover Cluster Manager snap-in, which is the management snap-in for the Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) service.  
  
## Maintaining a Failover Cluster Instance  
 After you have installed an FCI, you can change or repair it using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup program. For example, you can add additional nodes to an FCI, run an FCI as a stand-alone instance, or remove a node from a FCI configuration.  
  
### Adding a Node to an Existing Failover Cluster Instance  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup gives you the option of maintaining an existing FCI. If you choose this option, you can add other nodes to your FCI by running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup on the computer that you want to add to the FCI. For more information, see [Create a New SQL Server Failover Cluster &#40;Setup&#41;](../../../sql-server/failover-clusters/install/create-a-new-sql-server-failover-cluster-setup.md) and [Add or Remove Nodes in a SQL Server Failover Cluster &#40;Setup&#41;](../../../sql-server/failover-clusters/install/add-or-remove-nodes-in-a-sql-server-failover-cluster-setup.md).  
  
### Removing a Node from an Existing Failover Cluster Instance  
 You can remove a node from an FCI by running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup on the computer that you want to remove from the FCI. Each node in an FCI is considered a peer without dependencies on other nodes on the FCI, and you can remove any node. A damaged node does not have to be available to be removed, and the removal process does not uninstall the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] binaries from the unavailable node. A removed node can be added back to a FCI at any time. For more information, see [Add or Remove Nodes in a SQL Server Failover Cluster &#40;Setup&#41;](../../../sql-server/failover-clusters/install/add-or-remove-nodes-in-a-sql-server-failover-cluster-setup.md).  
  
### Changing Service Accounts  
 You should not change passwords for any of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service accounts when an FCI node is down or offline. If you must do this, you must reset the password again by using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager when all nodes are back online.  
  
 If the service account for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is not an administrator in your cluster, the administrative shares cannot be deleted on any nodes of the cluster. The administrative shares must be available in a cluster for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to function.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Do not use the same account for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service account and the WSFC service account. If the password changes for the WSFC service account, your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation will fail.  
  
 On [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/nextref-longhorn-md.md)], service SIDs are used for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service accounts. For more information, see [Configure Windows Service Accounts and Permissions](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/configure-windows-service-accounts-and-permissions.md).
