  The **SQLServer:Wait Statistics** performance object contains performance counters that report information about wait status.  
  
 The table below lists the counters that the Wait Statistics object contains.  
  
|SQL Server Wait Statistics counters|Description|  
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**Lock waits**|Statistics for processes waiting on a lock.|  
|**Log buffer waits**|Statistics for processes waiting for log buffer to be available.|  
|**Log write waits**|Statistics for processes waiting for log buffer to be written.|  
|**Memory grant queue waits**|Statistics for processes waiting for memory grant to become available.|  
|**Network IO waits**|Statistics relevant to wait on network I/O.|  
|**Non-Page latch waits**|Statistics relevant to non-page latches.|  
|**Page IO latch waits**|Statistics relevant to page I/O latches.|  
|**Page latch waits**|Statistics relevant to page latches, not including I/O latches.|  
|**Thread-safe memory objects waits**|Statistics for processes waiting on thread-safe memory allocators.|  
|**Transaction ownership waits**|Statistics relevant to processes synchronizing access to transaction.|  
|**Wait for the worker**|Statistics relevant to processes waiting for worker to become available.|
