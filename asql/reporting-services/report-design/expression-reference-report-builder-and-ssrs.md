# Expression Reference (Report Builder and SSRS)
  Report expressions support a variety of references to built-in functions and built-in collections. Expressions must have valid [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] syntax before a report can be published or processed.  
  
 To develop complex expressions or expressions that use custom code or custom assemblies, we recommend that you use Report Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. For more information, see [Custom Code and Assembly References in Expressions in Report Designer &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/custom-code-and-assembly-references-in-expressions-in-report-designer-ssrs.md).
