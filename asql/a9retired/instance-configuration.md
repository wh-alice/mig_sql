# Instance Configuration
  Use the **Instance Configuration** page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Wizard to specify whether to create a default instance or a named instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. If an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is not already installed, a default instance will be created unless you specify a named instance.  
  
 Each instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] consists of a distinct set of services that have specific settings for collations and other options. The directory structure, registry structure, and service names all reflect the instance name and a specific instance ID created during [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup.  
  
 An instance is either the default instance or a named instance. The default instance name is MSSQLSERVER. It does not require a client to specify the name of the instance to make a connection. A named instance is determined by the user during Setup. You can install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as a named instance without installing the default instance first. Only one installation of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], regardless of version, can be the default instance at one time.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  With [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] SysPrep, you can specify the instance name when you complete a prepared instance on the **Instance Configuration** page. You can choose to configure the prepared instance you are completing as a default instance if there is no existing default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on the machine.  
  
## Multiple Instances  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports multiple instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a single server or processor, but only one instance can be the default instance. All others must be named instances. A computer can run multiple instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] concurrently, and each instance runs independently of other instances.  
  
 For more information, see [Maximum Capacity Specifications for SQL Server](../sql-server/maximum-capacity-specifications-for-sql-server.md).  
  
## Options  
 Failover cluster instances only — Specify the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster network name. This name identifies the failover cluster instance on the network.  
  
 Default or Named instance — Consider the following information when you decide whether to install a default or named instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
-   If you plan to install a single instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a database server, it should be a default instance.  
  
-   Use a named instance for situations where you plan to have multiple instances on the same computer. A server can host only one default instance.  
  
-   Any application that installs [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../a9notintoc/includes/ssexpress-md.md)] should install it as a named instance. This will minimizes conflict when multiple applications are installed on the same computer.  
  
 **Default instance**  
 Select this option to install a default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. A computer can host only one default instance; all other instances must be named. However, if you have a default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installed, you can add a default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] to the same computer.  
  
 **Named instance**  
 Select this option to create a new named instance. Be aware of the following when you name an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
-   Instance names are not case sensitive.  
  
-   Instance names cannot start or end with an underscore (_).  
  
-   Instance names cannot contain the term "Default" or other reserved keywords. If a reserved keyword is used in an instance name, a Setup error will occur. For more information, see [Reserved Keywords &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../t-sql/language-elements/reserved-keywords-transact-sql.md).  
  
-   If you specify MSSQLServer for the instance name, a default instance will be created.  
  
-   An installation of [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiLong](../a9retired/includes/ssgeminilong-md.md)] is always installed as a named instance of '[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)]'. You cannot specify a different instance name for this feature role.  
  
-   Instance names are limited to 16 characters.  
  
-   The first character in the instance name must be a letter. Acceptable letters are those defined by the Unicode Standard 2.0. These include Latin characters a-z, A-Z, and letter characters from other languages.  
  
-   Subsequent characters can be letters defined by the Unicode Standard 2.0, decimal numbers from Basic Latin or other national scripts, the dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_).  
  
-   Embedded spaces or other special characters are not allowed in instance names. The backslash (\\), comma (,), colon (:), semi-colon (;), single quote ('), ampersand (&), hyphen (-), and at sign (@) are also not allowed.  
  
     Only characters that are valid in the current Windows code page can be used in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance names. If an unsupported Unicode character is used, a Setup error will occur.  
  
 **Detected instances and features**  
 View a list of installed [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instances and components on the computer where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup is running.  
  
 **Instance ID** - By default, the instance name is used as the Instance ID. This is used to identify installation directories and registry keys for your instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This is the case for default instances and named instances. For a default instance, the instance name and instance ID would be MSSQLSERVER. To use a non-default instance ID, specify it in the **Instance ID** field.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  With [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] SysPrep, the Instance ID displayed on this page is the Instance ID specified during the prepare image step of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] SysPrep process. You will not be able to specify a different Instance ID during the complete image step.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Instance IDs that begin with an underscore (_) or that contain the number sign (#) or the dollar sign ($) are not supported.  
  
 For more information about directories, file locations, and instance ID naming, see [File Locations for Default and Named Instances of SQL Server](../sql-server/install/file-locations-for-default-and-named-instances-of-sql-server.md).  
  
 All components of a given instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are managed as a unit. All [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service packs and upgrades will apply to every component of an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 All components of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that share the same instance name must meet the following criteria:  
  
-   **Same version**  
  
-   **Same edition**  
  
-   **Same language settings**  
  
-   **Same clustered state**  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] is not cluster-aware.  
  
-   **Same operating system**
