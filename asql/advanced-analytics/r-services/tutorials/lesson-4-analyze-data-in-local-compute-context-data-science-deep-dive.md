# Lesson 4: Analyze Data in Local Compute Context (Data Science Deep Dive)
Although typically it is much faster to run complex R code using the server context, it is sometimes more convenient to get your data out of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and analyze it on your private workstation.  
  
In this section, you'll learn how to switch back to a local compute context, and move data between contexts to optimize performance.  
  
## Create a Local Summary  
  
1.  Change the compute context to do all your work locally.  
  
    ```R  
    rxSetComputeContext ("local")    
    ```  
  
2.  When extracting data from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can often get better performance by increasing the number of rows extracted for each read.  To do this, increase the value for the *rowsPerRead* parameter on the data source.  
  
    ```R  
    sqlServerDS1 <- RxSqlServerData(  
       connectionString = sqlConnString,        
       table = sqlFraudTable,   
       colInfo = ccColInfo,   
       rowsPerRead = 10000)  
    ```  
  
    Previously, the value of *rowsPerRead* was set to 5000.  
  
3.  Now, call *rxSummary* on the new data source.  
  
    ```R  
    rxSummary(formula = ~gender + balance + numTrans + numIntlTrans + creditLine, data = sqlServerDS1)    
    ```  
  
    The actual results should be the same as when you run *rxSummary* in the context of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] computer.  However, the operation might be faster or slower. Much depends on the connection to your database, because the data is being transferred to your local computer for analysis.
