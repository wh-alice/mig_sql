# Back Up and Restore of System Databases (SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] maintains a set of system-level databases, s*ystem databases*, which are essential for the operation of a server instance. Several of the system databases must be backed up after every significant update. The system databases that you must always back up include **msdb**, **master**, and **model**. If any database uses replication on the server instance, there is a **distribution** system database that you must also back up. Backups of these system databases let you restore and recover the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system in the event of system failure, such as the loss of a hard disk.  
  
 The following table summarizes all of the system databases.  
  
|System database|Description|Are backups required?|Recovery model|Comments|  
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------|  
|[master](../../relational-databases/databases/master-database.md)|The database that records all of the system level information for a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system.|Yes|Simple|Back up **master** as often as necessary to protect the data sufficiently for your business needs. We recommend a regular backup schedule, which you can supplement with an additional backup after a substantial update.|  
|[model](../../relational-databases/databases/model-database.md)|The template for all databases that are created on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|Yes|User configurable*|Back up **model** only when necessary for your business needs; for example, immediately after customizing its database options.<br /><br /> **Best practice:** We recommend that you create only full database backups of **model**, as required. Because **model** is small and rarely changes, backing up the log is unnecessary.|  
|[msdb](../../relational-databases/databases/msdb-database.md)|The database used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent for scheduling alerts and jobs, and for recording operators. **msdb** also contains history tables such as the backup and restore history tables.|Yes|Simple (default)|Back up **msdb** whenever it is updated.|  
|[Resource](../../relational-databases/databases/resource-database.md) (RDB)|A read-only database that contains copies of all system objects that ship with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]|No|â€”|The **Resource** database resides in the mssqlsystemresource.mdf file, which contains only code. Therefore, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cannot back up the **Resource** database.<br /><br /> Note: You can perform a file-based or a disk-based backup on the mssqlsystemresource.mdf file by treating the file as if it were a binary (.exe) file, instead of a database file. But you cannot use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] restore on the backups. Restoring a backup copy of mssqlsystemresource.mdf can only be done manually, and you must be careful not to overwrite the current **Resource** database with an out-of-date or potentially insecure version.|  
|[tempdb](../../relational-databases/databases/tempdb-database.md)|A workspace for holding temporary or intermediate result sets. This database is re-created every time an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is started. When the server instance is shut down, any data in **tempdb** is deleted permanently.|No|Simple|You cannot back up the **tempdb** system database.|  
|[Configure Distribution](../../relational-databases/replication/configure-distribution.md)|A database that exists only if the server is configured as a replication Distributor. This database stores metadata and history data for all types of replication, and transactions for transactional replication.|Yes|Simple|For information about when to back up the **distribution** database, see [Back Up and Restore Replicated Databases](../../relational-databases/replication/administration/back-up-and-restore-replicated-databases.md).|  
  
 *To learn the current recovery model of the model, see [View or Change the Recovery Model of a Database &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/view-or-change-the-recovery-model-of-a-database-sql-server.md) or [sys.databases &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sys.databases-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Limitations on Restoring System Databases  
  
-   System databases can be restored only from backups that are created on the version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that the server instance is currently running. For example, to restore a system database on a server instance that is running on [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql11-md.md)] SP1, you must use a database backup that was created after the server instance was upgraded to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql11-md.md)] SP1.  
  
-   To restore any database, the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] must be running. Startup of an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] requires that the **master** database is accessible and at least partly usable. If **master** becomes unusable, you can return the database to a usable state in either of the following ways:  
  
    -   Restore **master** from a current database backup.  
  
         If you can start the server instance, you should be able to restore **master** from a full database backup.  
  
    -   Rebuild **master** completely.  
  
         If severe damage to **master** prevents you from starting [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you must rebuild **master**. For more information, see [Rebuild System Databases](../../relational-databases/databases/rebuild-system-databases.md).  
  
        > [!IMPORTANT]  
        >  Rebuilding **master** rebuilds all of the system databases.  
  
-   Under some circumstances, problems recovering the model database may require rebuilding the system databases or replacing the mdf and ldf files for the model database. For more information, see [Rebuild System Databases](../../relational-databases/databases/rebuild-system-databases.md).
