# Escape SQL Server Identifiers
  You can often use the Windows PowerShell back-tick escape character (`) to escape characters that are allowed in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] delimited identifiers but not Windows PowerShell path names. Some characters, however, cannot be escaped. For example, you cannot escape the colon character (:) in Windows PowerShell. Identifiers with that character must be encoded. Encoding is more reliable than escaping because encoding works for all characters.  
  
## Before You Begin  
 The back-tick character (`) is usually on the key in the upper left of the keyboard, under the ESC key.  
  
## Examples  
 This is an example of escaping a # character:  
  
```  
cd SQLSERVER:\SQL\MyComputer\MyInstance\MyDatabase\MySchema\`#MyTempTable  
```  
  
 This is an example of escaping the parenthesis when specifying (local) as a computer name:  
  
```  
Set-Location SQLSERVER:\SQL\`(local`)\DEFAULT  
```
