# Always On Policies for Operational Issues - Always On Availability
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  The [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] health model evaluates a set of predefined policy based management (PBM) policies. You can use theses for viewing the health of an availability group and its availability replicas and databases in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].

##  <a name="TermsAndDefinitions"></a> Terms and Definitions  
 Always On predefined policies  
 A set of built-in policies that allow a database administrator to check an availability group and its availability replicas and databases for compliance with the states that are defined by the Always On policies.  
  
 [Always On Availability Groups](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/always-on-availability-groups-sql-server.md)  
 A high-availability and disaster-recovery solution that provides an enterprise-level alternative to database mirroring.  
  
 availability group  
 A container for a discrete set of user databases, known as *availability databases*, that fail over together.  
  
 availability replica  
 An instantiation of an availability group that is hosted by a specific instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and that maintains a local copy of each availability database that belongs to the availability group. Two types of availability replicas exist: a single *primary replica* and one to four *secondary replicas*. The server instances that host the availability replicas for a given availability group must reside on different nodes of a single Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster.  
  
 availability database  
 A database that belongs to an availability group. For each availability database, the availability group maintains a single read-write copy (the *primary database*) and one to four read-only copies (*secondary databases*).  
  
 Always On Dashboard  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] dashboard that provides an at-a-glance view of the health of an availability group. For more information, see [Always On Dashboard](#Dashboard), later in this topic.  
  
##  <a name="Always OnPBM"></a> Predefined Policies and Issues  
 The following table summarizes the predefined policies.  
  
|Policy name|Issue|Category**\***|Facet|

|Availability Replica Data Synchronization State|[Data synchronization state of some availability database is not healthy](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/data-synchronization-state-of-some-availability-database-is-not-healthy.md).|Warning|Availability replica|  
|Availability Database Suspension State|[Availability database is suspended](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-database-is-suspended.md).|Warning|Availability database|  
|Availability Database Join State|[Secondary database is not joined](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/secondary-database-is-not-joined.md).|Warning|Availability database|

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  **\*** For Always On policies, the category names are used as IDs. Changing the name of an Always On category would break its health-evaluation functionality. Therefore, do not modify the names of Always On categories.  
  
##  <a name="Dashboard"></a> Always On Dashboard  
 The Always On Dashboard gives you an at-a-glance view of the health of an availability group. The Always On Dashboard includes the following features:  
  
-   Enables you to easily display details about a given availability group, its availability replicas, and its databases.  
  
-   Displays visual indications of key states to help database administrators make quick operational decisions.  
  
-   Provides launch points for troubleshooting scenarios.  
  
-   For a given operational issue, populates the **Policy Evaluation Result** dialog box with information about specific Always On health policy violations and with links to remediation help.  
  
-   Provides an health extended event viewer to show previous events for Always On-specific issues.  
  
-   If failing over the availability group is a possible remediation for an issue, provides a launch point for the links[Fail Over Availability Group Wizard](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/use-the-fail-over-availability-group-wizard-sql-server-management-studio.md). This wizard takes a database administrator through the manual failover process.  
  
##  <a name="ExtendHealthModel"></a> Extending the Always On Health Model  
 Extending the [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] health model is simply a matter of creating your own user-defined policies and putting them into certain categories based on the type of object that you are monitoring.  After you a alter few settings, the Always On dashboard will automatically evaluate your own user-defined policies, as well as the Always On predefined policies.  
  
 A user-defined policy can use any of the available PBM facets, including those used by the Always On predefined policies (see [Predefined Policies and Issues](#Always OnPBM), earlier in this topic). The Server facet provides the following properties for monitoring [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] health: (**IsHadrEnabled** and **HadrManagerStatus**). The Server facet also provides properties the following policies for monitoring the WSFC cluster configuration: **ClusterQuorumType**, and **ClusterQuorumState**.
