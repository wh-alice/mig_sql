# Delete a Database Diagram (Visual Database Tools)
When you no longer need a database diagram, you can delete it.

2.  Right-click the database diagram that you want to delete.  
  
3.  Choose **Delete** on the shortcut menu.  
  
4.  A message prompts you to confirm the deletion. Choose **Yes**.
