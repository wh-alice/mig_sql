# Administer Servers with SQL Server Management Studio
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio is a rich, integrated administrative client designed to meet the SQL Server and Azure SQL Database administrator's server management requirements. In Management Studio, administrative tasks are accomplished using Object Explorer, which allows you to connect to any server in the SQL Server family and graphically browse its contents. A server can be an instance of the Database Engine, Analysis Services, Reporting Services, Integration Services or Azure SQL Database.  
  
The tool components of Management Studio include Registered Servers, Object Explorer, Solution Explorer, Template Explorer, the Object Explorer Details page, and the document window. To display a tool, on the **View** menu, click the tool name. To display the Query Editor tool, click the **New Query** button on the toolbar.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Network traffic between Management Studio and SQL Server is unencrypted by default. Do not work with sensitive data (including passwords) in Management Studio unless you have established an encrypted connection. For more information, see [How to: Enable Encrypted Connections to the Database Engine (SQL Server Configuration Manager)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e1e55519-97ec-4404-81ef-881da3b42006).  
  
Use Management Studio to:  
  
-   Register servers.  
  
-   Connect to an instance of the Database Engine, SSAS, SSRS,  SSIS or Azure SQL Database.  
  
-   Configure server properties.  
  
-   Manage database and SSAS objects such as cubes, dimensions, and assemblies.  
  
-   Create objects, such as databases, tables, cubes, database users, and logins.  
  
-   Manage files and filegroups.  
  
-   Attach or detach databases.  
  
-   Launch scripting tools.  
  
-   Manage security.  
  
-   View system logs.  
  
-   Monitor current activity.  
  
-   Configure replication.  
  
-   Manage full-text indexes.  
  
To start and stop SQL Server or SQL Server Agent, use SQL Server Configuration Manager.
