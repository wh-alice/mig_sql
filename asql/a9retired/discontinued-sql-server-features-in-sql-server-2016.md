# Discontinued SQL Server Features in SQL Server 2016
  This topic describes features that are no longer available after you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
## Discontinued Features in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)]  
 [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../a9notintoc/includes/sssql15-md.md)] is a 64-bit application. 32-bit installation is discontinued, though some elements run as 32-bit components.
