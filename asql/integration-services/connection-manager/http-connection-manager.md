# HTTP Connection Manager
  An HTTP connection enables a package to access a Web server by using HTTP to send or receive files. The Web Service task that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] includes uses this connection manager.  
  
 When you add an HTTP connection manager to a package, [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] creates a connection manager that will resolve to an HTTP connection at run time, sets the connection manager properties, and adds the connection manager to the **Connections** collection on the package.  
  
 The **ConnectionManagerType** property of the connection manager is set to **HTTP.**  
  
 You can configure the HTTP connection manager the following ways:  
  
-   Use credentials. If the connection manager uses credentials, its properties include the user name, password, and domain.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The HTTP connection manager supports only anonymous authentication and basic authentication. It does not support Windows Authentication.  
  
-   Use a client certificate. If the connection manager uses a client certificate, its properties include the certificate name.  
  
-   Provide a time-out for connecting to the server and a chunk size for writing data.  
  
-   Use a proxy server. The proxy server can also be configured to use credentials and to bypass the proxy server and use local addresses instead.  
  
## Configuration of the HTTP Connection Manager  
 You can set properties through [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer or programmatically.  
  
 For more information about the properties that you can set in [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer, click one of the following topics:  
  
-   [HTTP Connection Manager Editor &#40;Server Page&#41;](../../integration-services/connection-manager/http-connection-manager-editor-server-page.md)  
  
-   [HTTP Connection Manager Editor &#40;Proxy Page&#41;](../../integration-services/connection-manager/http-connection-manager-editor-proxy-page.md)  
  
 For information about configuring a connection manager programmatically, see <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager>.
