# Adding Connections Programmatically
  The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> class represents physical connections to external data sources. The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> class isolates the implementation details of the connection from the runtime. This enables the runtime to interact with each connection manager in a consistent and predictable manner. Connection managers contain a set of stock properties that all connections have in common, such as the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Name%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.ID%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Description%2A>, and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.ConnectionString%2A>. However, the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.ConnectionString%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Name%2A> properties are ordinarily the only properties required to configure a connection manager. Unlike other programming paradigms, where connection classes expose methods such as **Open** or **Connect** to physically establish a connection to the data source, the run-time engine manages all the connections for the package while it runs.  
  
 The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Connections> class is a collection of the connection managers that have been added to that package and are available for use at run time. You can add more connection managers to the collection by using the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Connections.Add%2A> method of the collection, and supplying a string that indicates the connection manager type. The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Connections.Add%2A> method returns the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> instance that was added to the package.  
  
## Intrinsic Properties  
 The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> class exposes a set of properties that are common to all connections. However, sometimes you need access to properties that are unique to the specific connection type. The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Properties%2A> collection of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> class provides access to these properties. The properties can be retrieved from the collection using the indexer or the property name and the **GetValue** method, and the values are set using the **SetValue** method. The properties of the underlying connection object properties can also be set by acquiring an actual instance of the object and setting its properties directly. To get the underlying connection, use the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.InnerObject%2A> property of the connection manager. The following line of code shows a C# line that creates an ADO.NET connection manager that has the underlying class, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Wrapper.ConnectionManagerAdoNetClass>.  
  
 `ConnectionManagerAdoNetClass cmado = cm.InnerObject as ConnectionManagerAdoNet;`  
  
 This casts the managed connection manager object to its underlying connection object. If you are using C++, the **QueryInterface** method of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> object is called and the interface of the underlying connection object is requested.  
  
 The following table lists the connection managers included with [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]. and the string that is used in the `package.Connections.Add("xxx")` statement. For a list of all connection managers, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Connections](../../integration-services/connection-manager/integration-services-ssis-connections.md).

 The following code example demonstrates adding an OLE DB and FILE connection to the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Package.Connections%2A> collection of a <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Package>. The example then sets the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.ConnectionString%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Name%2A>, and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Description%2A> properties.

 **Sample Output:**
