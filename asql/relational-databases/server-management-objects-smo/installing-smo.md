# Installing SMO
  If you want to develop an application that uses [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO), you should select the Client Tools SDK when you install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. To install the Client Tooks SDK without installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], install Shared Management Objects from the [SQL Server feature pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=52676). If you want to ensure that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects is installed on a computer that will run your application, you can use the Shared Management Objects .msi in the [SQL Server feature pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=52676).  
  
 By default, the SMO assemblies are installed in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\SDK\Assemblies\ directory.
