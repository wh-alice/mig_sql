# Mining Model Viewer Tasks and How-tos
  Data Mining Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] contains several tools that you can use to explore mining models. The following topics provide step-by-step instructions on how to complete tasks that are specific to using the **Mining Model Viewer** tab in the designer.
