# Refresh from database (MySQLToSQL)
The **Refresh from Database** dialog box lets you select which objects to refresh from the MySQL database. Rows in the dialog box are color coded based on the state of the metadata:  
  
-   If the object metadata has changed locally and in the MySQL database, the row is blue.  
  
-   If the object metadata has changed in the MySQL database but not in SSMA, the row is yellow.  
  
-   If the object metadata has changed locally, but not in the MySQL database, the row is green.  
  
-   If the object is new in the MySQL database, the row is pink.  
  
You can specify default object refresh settings in the **Project Settings** dialog box. For more information, see [Project Settings &#40;Synchronization&#41; &#40;MySQLToSQL&#41;](../../ssma/mysql/project-settings--synchronization---mysqltosql-.md)  
  
To access the **Refresh from Database** dialog box, right-click an object in MySQL Metadata Explorer and click **Refresh from Database**.
