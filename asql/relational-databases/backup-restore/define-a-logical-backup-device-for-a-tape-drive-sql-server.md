# Define a Logical Backup Device for a Tape Drive (SQL Server)
  This topic describes how to define a logical backup device for a tape drive in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)]. A logical device is a user-defined name that points to a specific physical backup device (a disk file or tape drive).  The initialization of the physical device occurs later, when a backup is written to the backup device.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Support for tape backup devices will be removed in a future version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature.

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   The tape drive or drives must be supported by the Microsoft Windows operating system.  
  
-   The tape device must be connected physically to the computer that is running an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Backing up to remote tape devices is not supported.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Requires membership in the **diskadmin** fixed server role.  
  
 Requires permission to write to the disk.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To define a logical backup device for a tape drive  
  
1.  After connecting to the appropriate instance of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], in Object Explorer, click the server name to expand the server tree.  
  
2.  Expand **Server Objects**, and then right-click **Backup Devices**.  
  
3.  Click **New Backup Device**, which opens the **Backup Device** dialog box.  
  
4.  Enter a device name.  
  
5.  For the destination, click **Tape** and select a tape drive that is not already associated with another backup device. If no such tape drives are available, the **Tape** option is inactive.  
  
6.  To define the new device, click **OK**.  
  
 To back up to this new device, add it to the **Back up to:** field in the **Back up Database** (**General**) dialog box. For more information, see [Create a Full Database Backup &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/create-a-full-database-backup-sql-server.md).  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To define a logical backup device for a tape drive  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**. This example shows how to use [sp_addumpdevice](../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addumpdevice-transact-sql.md) to define a logical backup device for a tape. The example adds the tape backup device named `tapedump1`, with the physical name `\\.\tape0`.  
  
```tsql  
USE AdventureWorks2012 ;  
GO  
EXEC sp_addumpdevice 'tape', 'tapedump1', '\\.\tape0' ;  
GO  
```
