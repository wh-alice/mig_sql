 [ **@agent_type=**] *type*  
 Is the type of agent. *type* is **smallint**, with a default of **0**. **0** indicates a Distribution Agent. **1** indicates a Merge Agent.  
  
 [ **@frequency_type=**] *frequency_type*  
 Is the frequency with which to schedule the distribution task. *frequency_type* is **int**, with a default of **64**. There are 10 schedule columns.  
  
 [ **@frequency_interval=**] *frequency_interval*  
 Is the value applied to the frequency set by *frequency_type*. *frequency_interval* is **int**, with a default of **1**.  
  
 [ **@frequency_relative_interval=**] *frequency_relative_interval*  
 Is the date of the distribution task. *frequency_relative_interval* is **int**, with a default of **1**.  
  
 [ **@frequency_recurrence_factor=**] *frequency_recurrence_factor*  
 Is the recurrence factor used by *frequency_type*. *frequency_recurrence_factor* is **int**, with a default of **0**.  
  
 [ **@frequency_subday=**] *frequency_subday*  
 Is how often, in minutes, to reschedule during the defined period. *frequency_subday* is **int**, with a default of **4**.  
  
 [ **@frequency_subday_interval=**] *frequency_subday_interval*  
 Is the interval for *frequency_subday*. *frequency_subday_interval* is **int**, with a default of **5**.  
  
 [ **@active_start_time_of_day=**] *active_start_time_of_day*  
 Is the time of day when the distribution task is first scheduled. *active_start_time_of_day* is **int**, with a default of **0**.  
  
 [ **@active_end_time_of_day=**] *active_end_time_of_day*  
 Is the time of day when the distribution task stops being scheduled. *active_end_time_of_day* is **int**, with a default of **235959**, which means 11:59:59 P.M. on a 24-hour clock.  
  
 [ **@active_start_date=**] *active_start_date*  
 Is the date when the distribution task is first scheduled, formatted as YYYYMMDD. *active_start_date* is **int**, with a default of **0**.  
  
 [ **@active_end_date=**] *active_end_date*  
 Is the date when the distribution task stops being scheduled, formatted as YYYYMMDD. *active_end_date* is **int**, with a default of **99991231**, which means December 31, 9999.  
  
 [ **@publisher**= ] **'***publisher***'**
