# Deprecation Announcement Event Class
  The **Deprecation Announcement** event class occurs when you use a feature that will be removed from a future version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], but will not be removed from the next major release. For greatest longevity of your applications, avoid using features that cause the **Deprecation Announcement** event class or the **Deprecation Final Support** event class.  
  
## Deprecation Announcement Event Class Data Columns  
  
|Data column name|Data type|Description|Column ID|Filterable|  
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|  
|ApplicationName|**nvarchar**|Name of the client application that created the connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This column is populated with the values passed by the application rather than the displayed name of the program.|10|Yes|  
|ClientProcessID|**int**|ID assigned by the host computer to the process where the client application is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the client process ID.|9|Yes|  
|DatabaseID|**int**|ID of the database specified by the USE *database* statement or the default database if no USE *database* statement has been issued for a given instance. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the **ServerName** data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|  
|DatabaseName|**nvarchar**|Name of the database in which the user statement is running.|35|Yes|  
|EventClass|**int**|Type of event = 125.|27|No|  
|EventSequence|**int**|Sequence of a given event within the request.|51|No|  
|HostName|**nvarchar**|Name of the computer on which the client is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the host name. To determine the host name, use the HOST_NAME function.|8|Yes|  
|IntegerData2|**int**|End offset (in bytes) of the statement that is being executed.|55|Yes|  
|IsSystem|**int**|Indicates whether the event occurred on a system process or a user process. 1 = system, 0 = user.|60|Yes|  
|LoginName|**nvarchar**|Name of the login of the user (either [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security login or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows login credentials in the form of DOMAIN\username).|11|Yes|  
|LoginSid|**image**|Security identification number (SID) of the logged-in user. You can find this information in the sys.server_principals catalog view. Each SID is unique for each login in the server.|41|Yes|  
|NTDomainName|**nvarchar**|Windows domain to which the user belongs.|7|Yes|  
|NTUserName|**nvarchar**|Windows user name.|6|Yes|  
|ObjectID|**int**|ID number of the deprecated feature.|22|Yes|  
|ObjectName|**nvarchar**|Name of the deprecated feature.|34|Yes|  
|Offset|**int**|Starting offset of the statement within the stored procedure or batch.|61|Yes|  
|RequestID|**int**|ID of the request containing the statement.|49|Yes|  
|ServerName|**nvarchar**|Name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] being traced.|26|No|  
|SessionLoginName|**nvarchar**|Login name of the user who originated the session. For example, if you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using Login1 and execute a statement as Login2, **SessionLoginName**  shows Login1 and **LoginName** shows Login2. This column displays both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows logins.|64|Yes|  
|SPID|**int**|ID of the session on which the event occurred.|12|Yes|  
|SqlHandle|**image**|Binary handle that can be used to identify SQL batches or stored procedures.|63|Yes|  
|StartTime|**datetime**|Time at which the event started, if available.|14|Yes|  
|TextData|**ntext**|Text value dependent on the event class captured in the trace.|1|Yes|  
|TransactionID|**bigint**|System-assigned ID of the transaction.|4|Yes|  
|XactSequence|**bigint**|Token that describes the current transaction.|50|Yes|
