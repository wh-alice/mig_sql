 Is the previous status for the subscription. *previous_status* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL. This parameter allows you to change any subscriptions that currently have that status, thus allowing group functions on a specific set of subscriptions (for example, setting all active subscriptions back to **subscribed**).

## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_changesubstatus** is used in snapshot replication and transactional replication.  
  
 **sp_changesubstatus** changes the status of the Subscriber in the **syssubscriptions** table with the changed status. If required, it updates the article status in the **sysarticles** table to indicate active or inactive. If required, it sets the replication flag on or off in the **sysobjects** table for the replicated table.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role, **db_owner** fixed database role, or the creator of the subscription can execute **sp_changesubstatus**.
