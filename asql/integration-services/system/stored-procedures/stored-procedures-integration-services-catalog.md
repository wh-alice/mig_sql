# Stored Procedures (Integration Services Catalog)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../integration-services/system/stored-procedures/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This section describes the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] stored procedures that are available for administering [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] projects that have been deployed to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 Call the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] stored procedures to add, remove, modify, or execute objects that are stored in the **SSISDB** catalog.  
  
 The default name of the catalog is SSISDB. The objects that are stored in the catalog include projects, packages, parameters, environments, and operational history.  
  
 You can use the database views and stored procedures directly, or write custom code that calls the managed API. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] and the managed API query the views and call the stored procedures that are described in this section to perform many of their tasks.
