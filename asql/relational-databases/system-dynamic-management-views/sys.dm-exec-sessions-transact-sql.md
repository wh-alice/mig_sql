# sys.dm_exec_sessions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns one row per authenticated session on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. sys.dm_exec_sessions is a server-scope view that shows information about all active user connections and internal tasks. This information includes client version, client program name, client login time, login user, current session setting, and more. Use sys.dm_exec_sessions to first view the current system load and to identify a session of interest, and then learn more information about that session by using other dynamic management views or dynamic management functions.  
  
 The sys.dm_exec_connections, sys.dm_exec_sessions, and sys.dm_exec_requests dynamic management views map to the [sys.sysprocesses](../../relational-databases/system-compatibility-views/sys.sysprocesses-transact-sql.md) system table.  
  
> **NOTE:** To call this from [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name **sys.dm_pdw_nodes_exec_sessions**.

## Permissions  
Everyone can see their own session information.  
**[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:** Requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to see all sessions on the server.  
**[!INCLUDE[ssSDS_md](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)]:** Requires `VIEW DATABASE STATE` to see all connections to the current database. `VIEW DATABASE STATE` cannot be granted in the `master` database. 
  
  
## Remarks  
 When the **common criteria compliance enabled** server configuration option is enabled, logon statistics are displayed in the following columns.  
  
-   last_successful_logon  
  
-   last_unsuccessful_logon  
  
-   unsuccessful_logons  
  
 If this option is not enabled, these columns will return null values. For more information about how to set this server configuration option, see [common criteria compliance enabled Server Configuration Option](../../database-engine/configure/windows/common-criteria-compliance-enabled-server-configuration-option.md).

## Examples  
  
### A. Finding users that are connected to the server  
 The following example finds the users that are connected to the server and returns the number of sessions for each user.  
  
```tsql  
SELECT login_name ,COUNT(session_id) AS session_count   
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions   
GROUP BY login_name;  
```  
  
### B. Finding long-running cursors  
 The following example finds the cursors that have been open for more than a specific period of time, who created the cursors, and what session the cursors are on.  
  
```tsql  
USE master;  
GO  
SELECT creation_time ,cursor_id   
    ,name ,c.session_id ,login_name   
FROM sys.dm_exec_cursors(0) AS c   
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions AS s   
   ON c.session_id = s.session_id   
WHERE DATEDIFF(mi, c.creation_time, GETDATE()) > 5;  
```  
  
### C. Finding idle sessions that have open transactions  
 The following example finds sessions that have open transactions and are idle. An idle session is one that has no request currently running.  
  
```tsql  
SELECT s.*   
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions AS s  
WHERE EXISTS   
    (  
    SELECT *   
    FROM sys.dm_tran_session_transactions AS t  
    WHERE t.session_id = s.session_id  
    )  
    AND NOT EXISTS   
    (  
    SELECT *   
    FROM sys.dm_exec_requests AS r  
    WHERE r.session_id = s.session_id  
    );  
```  
  
### D. Finding information about a queries own connection  
 Typical query to gather information about a queries own connection.  
  
```tsql  
SELECT   
    c.session_id, c.net_transport, c.encrypt_option,   
    c.auth_scheme, s.host_name, s.program_name,   
    s.client_interface_name, s.login_name, s.nt_domain,   
    s.nt_user_name, s.original_login_name, c.connect_time,   
    s.login_time   
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections AS c  
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions AS s  
    ON c.session_id = s.session_id  
WHERE c.session_id = @@SPID;  
```
