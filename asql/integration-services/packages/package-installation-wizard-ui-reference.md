# Package Installation Wizard UI Reference
  Use the **Package Installation Wizard** to deploy a [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project, including the packages and miscellaneous files it contains and any package dependencies.  
  
 Before you deploy packages, you can create configurations and then deploy them with the packages. [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] uses configurations to dynamically update properties of packages and package objects at run time. For example, the connection string of an OLE DB connection can be set dynamically at run time by providing a configuration that maps a value to the property that contains the connection string.  
  
 You cannot run the Package Installation Wizard until you build an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project and create a deployment utility. For more information, see [Deploy Packages by Using the Deployment Utility](../../integration-services/packages/deploy-packages-by-using-the-deployment-utility.md).  
  
 The following sections describe pages of the wizard.  
  
## Welcome to the Package Installation Wizard Page

Use this option if [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] shares packages between servers. Any package dependencies are installed in the specified folder in the file system.

### Options  
 **Server name**  
 Specify the name of the server to deploy the packages to.  
  
 **Use Windows Authentication**  
 Specify whether to use Windows Authentication to log on to the server. Windows Authentication is recommended for better security.  
  
 **Use SQL Server Authentication**  
 Specify whether the package should use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication to log on to the server. If you use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication, you must provide a user name and password.

This page provides details such as the name of the deployed [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project, the packages that were installed, the configuration files, and the installation location.
