|DatabaseID|**int**|ID of the database specified by the USE *database* statement or the default database if no USE *database* statement has been issued for a specified instance. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the ServerName data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|

|Duration|**bigint**|Amount of time (in microseconds) taken by the event.|13|Yes|  
|EndTime|**datetime**|For Mount Request events, the time of the mount time-out if a time-out occurs; otherwise, the time of the event itself (in such cases, StartTime indicates the time of the corresponding mount request).|15|Yes|  
|EventClass|**int**|Type of event = 195.|27|No|  
|EventSequence|**int**|The sequence of a specified event within the request.|51|No|

|GroupID|**int**|ID of the workload group where the SQL Trace event fires.|66|Yes|
