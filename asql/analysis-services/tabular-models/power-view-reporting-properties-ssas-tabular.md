# Power View - Reporting Properties (SSAS Tabular)
  [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscrescent-md.md)] provides intuitive ad-hoc reporting for business users such as data analysts, business decision makers, and information workers. They can easily create and interact with views of data from tabular models based on [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks published in a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Gallery, or tabular models authored by using [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] and then deployed to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Analysis Services instances. [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscrescent-md.md)] is a browser-based Silverlight application launched from SharePoint Server 2010 or later.  
  
 When authoring tabular model projects in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)], you can configure certain reporting properties unique to [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscrescent-md.md)] reports. Topics in this section describe how to optimize a model to improve the reporting experience in [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscrescent-md.md)].
