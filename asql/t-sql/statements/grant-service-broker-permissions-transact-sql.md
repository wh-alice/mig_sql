       | [ ROUTE :: route_name ]   
       | [ SERVICE :: service_name ]      
    }  
    TO database_principal [ ,...n ]   
    [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]  
        [ AS granting_principal ]

## Remarks  
  
## Service Broker Contracts  
 A Service Broker contract is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be granted on a Service Broker contract are listed below, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Service Broker contract permission|Implied by Service Broker contract permission|Implied by database permission|  
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY CONTRACT|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Service Broker Message Types  
 A Service Broker message type is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be granted on a Service Broker message type are listed below, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Service Broker message type permission|Implied by Service Broker message type permission|Implied by database permission|  
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY MESSAGE TYPE|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|

## Service Broker Remote Service Bindings  
 A Service Broker remote service binding is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be granted on a Service Broker remote service binding are listed below, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Service Broker remote service binding permission|Implied by Service Broker remote service binding permission|Implied by database permission|  
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY REMOTE SERVICE BINDING|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Service Broker Routes  
 A Service Broker route is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be granted on a Service Broker route are listed below, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Service Broker route permission|Implied by Service Broker route permission|Implied by database permission|

## Permissions  
 The grantor (or the principal specified with the AS option) must have either the permission itself with GRANT OPTION, or a higher permission that implies the permission being granted.  
  
 If using the AS option, these additional requirements apply.  
  
|AS *granting_principal*|Additional permission required|  
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|Database user|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a Windows login|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a Windows group|Membership in the Windows group, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a certificate|Membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to an asymmetric key|Membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user not mapped to any server principal|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database role|ALTER permission on the role, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Application role|ALTER permission on the role, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
  
 Object owners can grant permissions on the objects they own. Principals with CONTROL permission on a securable can grant permission on that securable.  
  
 Grantees of CONTROL SERVER permission, such as members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role, can grant any permission on any securable in the server. Grantees of CONTROL permission on a database, such as members of the **db_owner** fixed database role, can grant any permission on any securable in the database. Grantees of CONTROL permission on a schema can grant any permission on any object within the schema.
