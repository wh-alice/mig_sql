# SQL Trace
  In SQL Trace, events are gathered if they are instances of event classes listed in the trace definition. These events can be filtered out of the trace or queued for their destination. The destination can be a file or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO), which can use the trace information in applications that manage [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)] Use Extended Events instead.  
  
## Benefits of SQL Trace  
 Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] system stored procedures to create traces on an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. These system stored procedures can be used from within your own applications to create traces manually, instead of using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)]. This allows you to write custom applications specific to the needs of your enterprise.  
  
## SQL Trace Architecture  
 Event Sources can be any source that produces the trace event, such as [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] batches or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] events, such as deadlocks. For more information about events, see [SQL Server Event Class Reference](../../relational-databases/event-classes/sql-server-event-class-reference.md). After an event occurs, if the event class has been included in a trace definition, the event information is gathered by the trace. If filters have been defined for the event class in the trace definition, the filters are applied and the trace event information is passed to a queue. From the queue, the trace information is either written to a file or can be used by SMO in applications, such as [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)]. The following diagram shows how SQL Trace gathers events during a tracing.

## SQL Trace Terminology  
 The following terms describe the key concepts of SQL Trace.  
  
 **Event**  
 The occurrence of an action within an instance of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)].  
  
 **Data column**  
 An attribute of an event.  
  
 **Event class**  
 A type of event that can be traced. The event class contains all of the data columns that can be reported by an event.  
  
 **Event category**  
 A group of related event classes.  
  
 **Trace** (noun)  
 A collection of events and data returned by the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
 **Trace** (verb)  
 To collect and monitor events in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 **Tracedefinition**  
 A collection of event classes, data columns and filters that identify the types of events to be collected during a trace.  
  
 **Filter**  
 Criteria that limit the events that are collected in a trace.  
  
 **Trace file**  
 A file created when a trace is saved.  
  
 **Template**  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)], a file that defines the event classes and data columns to be collected in a trace.  
  
 **Trace table**  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)], a table that is created when a trace is saved to a table.  
  
## Use Data Columns to Describe Returned Events  
 SQL Trace uses data columns in the trace output to describe events that are returned when the trace runs. The following table describes the [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] data columns, which are the same data columns as those used by SQL Trace, and indicates the columns that are selected by default.  
  
|Data column|Column number|Description|  
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|  
|**ApplicationName***|10|The name of the client application that created the connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This column is populated with the values passed by the application and not the name of the program.|  
|**BigintData1**|52|Value (**bigint** data type), which depends on the event class specified in the trace.|  
|**BigintData2**|53|Value (**bigint** data type), which depends on the event class specified in the trace.|  
|**Binary Data**|2|The binary value dependent on the event class that is captured in the trace.|  
|**ClientProcessID***|9|The ID assigned by the host computer to the process where the client application is running. This data column is populated if the client process ID is provided by the client.|  
|**ColumnPermissions**|44|Indicates whether a column permission was set. You can parse the statement text to determine which permissions were applied to which columns.|  
|**CPU**|18|The amount of CPU time (in milliseconds) that is used by the event.|  
|**Database ID***|3|The ID of the database specified by the USE *database_name* statement, or the ID of the default database if no USE *database_name*statement has been issued for a given instance. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the **ServerName** data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|  
|**DatabaseName**|35|The name of the database in which the user statement is running.|  
|**DBUserName***|40|The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] user name of the client.|  
|**Duration**|13|The duration (in microseconds) of the event.<br /><br /> The server reports the duration of an event in microseconds (one millionth, or 10<sup>-6</sup>, of a second) and the amount of CPU time used by the event in milliseconds (one thousandth, or 10<sup>-3</sup>, of a second). The [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] graphical user interface displays the **Duration** column in milliseconds by default, but when a trace is saved to either a file or a database table, the **Duration** column value is written in microseconds.|  
|**EndTime**|15|The time at which the event ended. This column is not populated for event classes that refer to an event that is starting, such as **SQL:BatchStarting** or **SP:Starting**.|  
|**Error**|31|The error number of a given event. Often this is the error number stored in **sysmessages**.|  
|**EventClass***|27|The type of event class that is captured.|  
|**EventSequence**|51|Sequence number for this event.|  
|**EventSubClass***|21|The type of event subclass, which provides further information about each event class. For example, event subclass values for the **Execution Warning** event class represent the type of execution warning:<br /><br /> **1** = Query wait. The query must wait for resources before it can execute; for example, memory.<br /><br /> **2** = Query time-out. The query timed out while waiting for required resources to execute. This data column is not populated for all event classes.|  
|**GUID**|54|GUID value which depends on the event class specified in the trace.|  
|**FileName**|36|The logical name of the file that is modified.|  
|**Handle**|33|The integer used by ODBC, OLE DB, or DB-Library to coordinate server execution.|  
|**HostName***|8|The name of the computer on which the client is running. This data column is populated if the host name is provided by the client. To determine the host name, use the HOST_NAME function.|  
|**IndexID**|24|The ID for the index on the object affected by the event. To determine the index ID for an object, use the **indid** column of the **sysindexes** system table.|  
|**IntegerData**|25|The integer value dependent on the event class captured in the trace.|  
|**IntegerData2**|55|The integer value dependent on the event class captured in the trace.|  
|**IsSystem**|60|Indicates whether the event occurred on a system process or a user process:<br /><br /> **1** = system<br /><br /> **0** = user|  
|**LineNumber**|5|Contains the number of the line that contains the error. For events that involve [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, like **SP:StmtStarting**, the **LineNumber** contains the line number of the statement in the stored procedure or batch.|  
|**LinkedServerName**|45|Name of the linked server.|  
|**LoginName**|11|The name of the login of the user (either SQL Server security login or the Windows login credentials in the form of DOMAIN\Username).|  
|**LoginSid***|41|The security identifier (SID) of the logged-in user. You can find this information in the **sys.server_principals** view of the **master** database. Each login to the server has a unique ID.|

|**Permissions**|19|The integer value that represents the type of permissions checked. Values are:<br /><br /> **1** = SELECT ALL<br /><br /> **2** = UPDATE ALL<br /><br /> **4** = REFERENCES ALL<br /><br /> **8** = INSERT<br /><br /> **16** = DELETE<br /><br /> **32** = EXECUTE (procedures only)<br /><br /> **4096** = SELECT ANY (at least one column)<br /><br /> **8192** = UPDATE ANY<br /><br /> **16384** = REFERENCES ANY|  
|**ProviderName**|46|Name of the OLEDB provider.|  
|**Reads**|16|The number of read operations on the logical disk that are performed by the server on behalf of the event. These read operations include all reads from tables and buffers during the statement's execution.|
