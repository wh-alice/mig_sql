# MDX Data Definition - CREATE MEASURE
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Creates a measure in a Tabular Model.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
CREATE MEASURE Table_Name[Measure_Name] = DAX_Expression  
[; CREATE MEASURE ...n]  
  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Table_Name*  
 A valid string literal that provides the name of the table where the measure will be created.  
  
 *Measure_Name*  
 A valid string literal that provides a measure name.  
  
 *DAX_Expression*  
 A valid DAX expression that returns a single scalar value.  
  
## Remarks  
 The *Measure_Name*  must be enclosed in square parenthesis.  
  
 The CREATE MEASURE statement can only be used inside of a MDX script definition; see [MdxScript Element &#40;ASSL&#41;](../analysis-services/scripting/objects/mdxscript-element-assl.md).  
  
 You can also define a calculated member for use by a single query. To define a calculated member that is limited to a single query, you use the WITH clause in the SELECT statement. For more information, see [Building Measures in MDX](../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/mdx/mdx-building-measures.md).
