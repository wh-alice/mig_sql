# Disable Resource Governor
  You can disable the Resource Governor by using either [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or Transact-SQL.  
  
-   **Before you begin:**  [Limitations and Restrictions](#LimitationsRestrictions), [Permissions](#Permissions)  
  
-   **To disable Resource Governorn, using:**  [Object Explorer](#RGOffObjEx), [Resource Governor Properties](#RGOffProp), [Transact-SQL](#RGOffTSQL)  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
 Disabling the Resource Governor has the following results:  
  
-   The classifier function is not run.  
  
-   All new connections are automatically classified into the default workload group.  
  
-   System-initiated requests are classified into the internal workload group.  
  
-   All existing workload group and resource pool settings are reset to their default values. In this case, no events are fired when limits are reached.  
  
-   Normal system monitoring is not affected.  
  
-   Configuration changes can be made, but the changes do not take effect until the Resource Governor is enabled.  
  
-   Upon restarting SQL Server, the Resource Governor will not load its configuration, but instead will have only the default and internal workload groups and resource pools.
