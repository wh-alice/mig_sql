# CREATE TYPE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Creates an alias data type or a user-defined type in the current database in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)]. The implementation of an alias data type is based on a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] native system type. A user-defined type is implemented through a class of an assembly in the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR). To bind a user-defined type to its implementation, the CLR assembly that contains the implementation of the type must first be registered in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [CREATE ASSEMBLY](../../t-sql/statements/create-assembly-transact-sql.md).  
  
 The ability to run CLR code is off by default in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You can create, modify and drop database objects that reference managed code modules, but these references will not execute in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] unless the [clr enabled Option](../../database-engine/configure/windows/clr-enabled-server-configuration-option.md) is enabled by using [sp_configure](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md).  
 
> [!NOTE]  
>  The integration of .NET Framework CLR into SQL Server is discussed in this topic. CLR integration does not apply to Azure [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)].

## Arguments  
 *schema_name*  
 Is the name of the schema to which the alias data type or user-defined type belongs.  
  
 *type_name*  
 Is the name of the alias data type or user-defined type. Type names must comply with the rules for [identifiers](../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md).  
  
 *base_type*  
 Is the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supplied data type on which the alias data type is based. *base_type* is **sysname**, with no default, and can be one of the following values:  
  
|||||  
|-|-|-|-|  
|**bigint**|**binary(** *n* **)**|**bit**|**char(** *n* **)**|  
|**date**|**datetime**|**datetime2**|**datetimeoffset**|  
|**decimal**|**float**|**image**|**int**|  
|**money**|**nchar(** *n* **)**|**ntext**|**numeric**|  
|**nvarchar(** *n* &#124; **max)**|**real**|**smalldatetime**|**smallint**|  
|**smallmoney**|**sql_variant**|**text**|**time**|  
|**tinyint**|**uniqueidentifier**|**varbinary(** *n* &#124; **max)**|**varchar(** *n* &#124; **max)**|  
  
 *base_type* can also be any data type synonym that maps to one of these system data types.  
  
 *precision*  
 For **decimal** or **numeric**, is a non-negative integer that indicates the maximum total number of decimal digits that can be stored, both to the left and to the right of the decimal point. For more information, see [decimal and numeric &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/data-types/decimal-and-numeric-transact-sql.md).  
  
 *scale*  
 For **decimal** or **numeric**, is a non-negative integer that indicates the maximum number of decimal digits that can be stored to the right of the decimal point, and it must be less than or equal to the precision. For more information, see [decimal and numeric &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/data-types/decimal-and-numeric-transact-sql.md).  
  
 **NULL** | NOT NULL  
 Specifies whether the type can hold a null value. If not specified, NULL is the default.  
  
 *assembly_name*  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Specifies the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] assembly that references the implementation of the user-defined type in the common language runtime. *assembly_name* should match an existing assembly in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in the current database.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  EXTERNAL_NAME is not available in a contained database.  
  
 **[.** *class_name*  **]**  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Specifies the class within the assembly that implements the user-defined type. *class_name* must be a valid identifier and must exist as a class in the assembly with assembly visibility. *class_name* is case-sensitive, regardless of the database collation, and must exactly match the class name in the corresponding assembly. The class name can be a namespace-qualified name enclosed in square brackets (**[ ]**) if the programming language that is used to write the class uses the concept of namespaces, such as C#. If *class_name* is not specified, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] assumes it is the same as *type_name*.  
  
 <column_definition>  
 Defines the columns for a user-defined table type.  
  
 \<data type>  
 Defines the data type in a column for a user-defined table type. For more information about data types, see [Data Types &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/data-types/data-types-transact-sql.md). For more information about tables, see [CREATE TABLE &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-table-transact-sql.md).  
  
 <column_constraint>  
 Defines the column constraints for a user-defined table type. Supported constraints include PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, and CHECK. For more information about tables, see [CREATE TABLE &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-table-transact-sql.md).  
  
 <computed_column_definition>  
 Defines a computed column expression as a column in a user-defined table type. For more information about tables, see [CREATE TABLE &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-table-transact-sql.md).  
  
 <table_constraint>  
 Defines a table constraint on a user-defined table type. Supported constraints include PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, and CHECK.  
  
 <index_option>  
 Specifies the error response to duplicate key values in a multiple-row insert operation on a unique clustered or unique nonclustered index. For more information about index options, see [CREATE INDEX &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-index-transact-sql.md).  
  
 INDEX  
 You must specify column and table indexes as part of the CREATE TABLE statement. CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX are not supported for memory-optimized tables.  
  
 MEMORY_OPTIMIZED  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].|  
  
 Indicates whether the table type is memory optimized. This option is off by default; the table (type) is not a memory optimized table (type). Memory optimized table types are memory-optimized user tables, the schema of which is persisted on disk similar to other user tables.  
  
 BUCKET_COUNT  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].|  
  
 Indicates the number of buckets that should be created in the hash index. The maximum value for BUCKET_COUNT in hash indexes is 1,073,741,824. For more information about bucket counts, see [Indexes for Memory-Optimized Tables](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/indexes-for-memory-optimized-tables.md). *bucket_count* is a required argument.  
  
 HASH  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].|  
  
 Indicates that a HASH index is created. Hash indexes are supported only on memory optimized tables.  
  
## Remarks  
 The class of the assembly that is referenced in *assembly_name*, together with its methods, should satisfy all the requirements for implementing a user-defined type in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information about these requirements, see [CLR User-Defined Types](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-user-defined-types/clr-user-defined-types.md).  
  
 Additional considerations include the following:  
  
-   The class can have overloaded methods, but these methods can be called only from within managed code, not from [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)].  
  
-   Any static members must be declared as **const** or **readonly** if *assembly_name* is SAFE or EXTERNAL_ACCESS.  
  
 Within a database, there can be only one user-defined type registered against any specified type that has been uploaded in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] from the CLR. If a user-defined type is created on a CLR type for which a user-defined type already exists in the database, CREATE TYPE fails with an error. This restriction is required to avoid ambiguity during SQL Type resolution if a CLR type can be mapped to more than one user-defined type.  
  
 If any mutator method in the type does not return *void*, the CREATE TYPE statement does not execute.  
  
 To modify a user-defined type, you must drop the type by using a DROP TYPE statement and then re-create it.  
  
 Unlike user-defined types that are created by using **sp_addtype**, the **public** database role is not automatically granted REFERENCES permission on types that are created by using CREATE TYPE. This permission must be granted separately.  
  
 In user-defined table types, structured user-defined types that are used in *column_name* \<data type> are part of the database schema scope in which the table type is defined. To access structured user-defined types in a different scope within the database, use two-part names.  
  
 In user-defined table types, the primary key on computed columns must be PERSISTED and NOT NULL.  
  
## Memory-Optimized Table Types  
 Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)], processing data in a table type can be done in primary memory, and not on disk. For more information, see [In-Memory OLTP &#40;In-Memory Optimization&#41;](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/in-memory-oltp-in-memory-optimization.md). For code samples showing how to create memory-optimized table types, see [Creating a Memory-Optimized Table and a Natively Compiled Stored Procedure](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/creating-a-memory-optimized-table-and-a-natively-compiled-stored-procedure.md).  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CREATE TYPE permission in the current database and ALTER permission on *schema_name*. If *schema_name* is not specified, the default name resolution rules for determining the schema for the current user apply. If *assembly_name* is specified, a user must either own the assembly or have REFERENCES permission on it.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Creating an alias type based on the varchar data type  
 The following example creates an alias type based on the system-supplied `varchar` data type.  
  
```  
CREATE TYPE SSN  
FROM varchar(11) NOT NULL ;  
```  
  
### B. Creating a user-defined type  
 The following example creates a type `Utf8String` that references class `utf8string` in the assembly `utf8string`. Before creating the type, assembly `utf8string` is registered in the local database. Replace the binary portion of the CREATE ASSEMBLY statement with a valid description.  
  
||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
```  
CREATE ASSEMBLY utf8string  
AUTHORIZATION [dbi]   
FROM 0x4D... ;  
GO  
CREATE TYPE Utf8String   
EXTERNAL NAME utf8string.[Microsoft.Samples.SqlServer.utf8string] ;  
GO  
```  
  
### C. Creating a user-defined table type  
 The following example creates a user-defined table type that has two columns. For more information about how to create and use table-valued parameters, see [Use Table-Valued Parameters &#40;Database Engine&#41;](../../relational-databases/tables/use-table-valued-parameters-database-engine.md).  
  
```  
/* Create a user-defined table type */  
CREATE TYPE LocationTableType AS TABLE   
    ( LocationName VARCHAR(50)  
    , CostRate INT );  
GO  
```
