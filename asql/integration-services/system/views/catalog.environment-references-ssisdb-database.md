|project_id|**bigint**|The unique ID of the project.|

## Remarks  
 This view displays a row for each environment reference in the catalog.  
  
## Permissions  
 This view requires one of the following permissions:  
  
-   READ permission on the corresponding project  
  
-   Membership to the **ssis_admin** database role  
  
-   Membership to the **sysadmin** server role.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you have READ permission on a project, you also have READ permission on all of the packages and environment references associated with that project. Row-level security is enforced; only rows that you have permission to view are displayed.  
  
## Remarks  
 A project can have relative or absolute environment references. Relative references refer to the environment by name and require that it resides in the same folder as the project. Absolute references refer to the environment by name and folder, and may refer to environments that reside in a different folder than the project. A project can reference multiple environments.
