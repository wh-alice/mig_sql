# CLR Integration Architecture
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] integration with the .NET Framework common language runtime (CLR) enables database programmers to use languages such as Visual C#, Visual Basic .NET, and Visual C++. Functions, stored procedures, triggers, data types, and aggregates are among the kinds of business logic that programmers can write with these languages.  
  
 This section describes the architecture of CLR integration inside [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and how this architecture provides a safe, scalable, secure, and efficient environment to run user code.  
  
 The following table lists the topics in this section.  
  
 [CLR Hosted Environment](../relational-databases/clr-integration/clr-integration-architecture-clr-hosted-environment.md)  
 Discusses architectural design goals, mechanisms, and benefits of CLR integration.  
  
 [Performance of CLR Integration](../relational-databases/clr-integration/clr-integration-architecture-performance.md)  
 Covers performance considerations of the CLR integration architecture.
