# Set the Properties of a Path by Using the Data Flow Path Editor
  Paths connect two data flow components. Before you can set path properties, the data flow must contain at least two connected data flow components. For more information, see [Add or Delete a Component in a Data Flow](../integration-services/data-flow/add-or-delete-a-component-in-a-data-flow.md) and [Connect Components in a Data Flow](../integration-services/data-flow/connect-components-in-a-data-flow.md).  
  
### To set path properties  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  Click the **Data Flow** tab, and then double-click a path.  
  
4.  In **Data Flow Path Editor**, click **General**. You can then edit the default name of the path and provide a description of the path. You can also modify the PathAnnotation property.  
  
5.  Click **OK**.  
  
6.  To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.
