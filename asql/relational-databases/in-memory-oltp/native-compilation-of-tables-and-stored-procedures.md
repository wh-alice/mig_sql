# Native Compilation of Tables and Stored Procedures
  In-Memory OLTP introduces the concept of native compilation. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can natively compile stored procedures that access memory-optimized tables. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is also able to natively compile memory-optimized tables. Native compilation allows faster data access and more efficient query execution than interpreted (traditional) [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)]. Native compilation of tables and stored procedures produce DLLs.  
  
 Native compilation of memory optimized table types is also supported. For more information, see [Faster temp table and table variable by using memory optimization](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/faster-temp-table-and-table-variable-by-using-memory-optimization.md).  
  
 Native compilation refers to the process of converting programming constructs to native code, consisting of processor instructions without the need for further compilation or interpretation.  
  
 In-Memory OLTP compiles memory-optimized tables when they are created, and natively compiled stored procedures when they are loaded to native DLLs. In addition, the DLLs are recompiled after a database or server restart. The information necessary to recreate the DLLs is stored in the database metadata. The DLLs are not part of the database, though they are associated with the database. For example, the DLLs are not included in database backups.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Memory-optimized tables are recompiled during a server restart. To speed up database recovery, natively compiled stored procedures are not recompiled during a server restart, they are compiled at the time of first execution. As a result of this deferred compilation, natively compiled stored procedures only appear when calling [sys.dm_os_loaded_modules &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys.dm-os-loaded-modules-transact-sql.md) after first execution.  
  
## Maintenance of In-Memory OLTP DLLs  
 The following query shows all table and stored procedure DLLs currently loaded in memory on the server:  
  
```tsql  
SELECT name, description FROM sys.dm_os_loaded_modules  
where description = 'XTP Native DLL'  
```  
  
 Database administrators do not need to maintain files that are generated by a native compilation. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] automatically removes generated files that are no longer needed. For example, generated files will be deleted when a table and stored procedure is deleted, or if a database is dropped.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If compilation fails or is interrupted, some generated files are not removed. These files are intentionally left behind for supportability and are removed when the database is dropped.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  SQL Server compiles DLLs for all tables needed for database recovery. If a table was dropped just prior to a database restart there can still be remnants of the table in the checkpoint files or the transaction log so the DLL for the table might be recompiled during database startup. After restart the DLL will be unloaded and the files will be removed by the normal cleanup process.  
  
## Native Compilation of Tables  
 Creating a memory-optimized table using the **CREATE TABLE** statement results in the table information being written to the database metadata and the table and index structures created in memory. The table will also be compiled to a DLL.  
  
 Consider the following sample script, which creates a database and a memory-optimized table:  
  
```tsql  
use master  
go  
create database db1  
go  
alter database db1 add filegroup db1_mod contains memory_optimized_data  
go  
-- adapt filename as needed  
alter database db1 add file (name='db1_mod', filename='c:\data\db1_mod') to filegroup db1_mod  
go  
use db1  
go  
create table dbo.t1  
   (c1 int not null primary key nonclustered,  
    c2 INT)  
with (memory_optimized=on)  
go  
-- retrieve the path of the DLL for table t1  
select name, description FROM sys.dm_os_loaded_modules  
where name like '%xtp_t_' + cast(db_id() as varchar(10)) + '_' + cast(object_id('dbo.t1') as varchar(10)) + '.dll'  
go  
```  
  
 Creating the table also creates the table DLL and loads the DLL in memory. The DMV query immediately after the CREATE TABLE statement retrieves the path of the table DLL.  
  
 The table DLL understands the index structures and row format of the table. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses the DLL for traversing indexes, retrieving rows, as well as storing the contents of the rows.  
  
## Native Compilation of Stored Procedures  
 Stored procedures that are marked with NATIVE_COMPILATION are natively compiled. This means the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements in the procedure are all compiled to native code for efficient execution of performance-critical business logic.  
  
 For more information about natively compiled stored procedures, see [Natively Compiled Stored Procedures](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/natively-compiled-stored-procedures.md).  
  
 Consider the following sample stored procedure, which inserts rows in the table t1 from the previous example:  
  
```tsql  
create procedure dbo.native_sp  
with native_compilation, schemabinding, execute as owner  
as  
begin atomic  
with (transaction isolation level=snapshot, language=N'us_english')  
  
  declare @i int = 1000000  
  while @i > 0  
  begin  
    insert dbo.t1 values (@i, @i+1)  
    set @i -= 1  
  end  
  
end  
go  
exec dbo.native_sp  
go  
-- reset  
delete from dbo.t1  
go  
```  
  
 The DLL for native_sp can interact directly with the DLL for t1, as well as the In-Memory OLTP storage engine, to insert the rows as fast as possible.  
  
 The In-Memory OLTP compiler leverages the query optimizer to create an efficient execution plan for each of the queries in the stored procedure. Note that natively compiled stored procedures are not automatically recompiled if the data in the table changes. For more information on maintaining statistics and stored procedures with In-Memory OLTP see [Statistics for Memory-Optimized Tables](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/statistics-for-memory-optimized-tables.md).  
  
## Security Considerations for Native Compilation  
 Native compilation of tables and stored procedures uses the In-Memory OLTP compiler. This compiler produces files that are written to disk and loaded into memory. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses the following mechanisms to limit access to these files.  
  
### Native Compiler  
 The compiler executable, as well as binaries and header files required for native compilation are installed as part of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance under the folder MSSQL\Binn\Xtp. So, if the default instance is installed under C:\Program Files, the compiler files are installed in C:\Program Files\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn\Xtp.  
  
 To limit access to the compiler, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to binary files. All [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] binaries are protected against modification or tampering through ACLs. The native compiler's ACLs also limit use of the compiler; only the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service account and system administrators have read and execute permissions for native compiler files.  
  
### Files Generated by a Native Compilation  
 The files produced when a table or stored procedure is compiled include the DLL and intermediate files including files with the following extensions: .c, .obj, .xml, and .pdb. The generated files are saved in a subfolder of the default data folder. The subfolder is called Xtp. When installing the default instance with the default data folder, the generated files are placed in C:\Program Files\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\Xtp.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] prevents tampering with the generated DLLs in three ways:  
  
-   When a table or stored procedure is compiled to a DLL, this DLL is immediately loaded into memory and linked to the sqlserver.exe process. A DLL cannot be modified while it is linked to a process.  
  
-   When a database is restarted, all tables and stored procedures are recompiled (removed and recreated) based on the database metadata. This will remove any changes made to a generated file by a malicious agent.  
  
-   The generated files are considered part of user data, and have the same security restrictions, via ACLs, as database files: only the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service account and system administrators can access these files.  
  
 No user interaction is needed to manage these files. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will create and remove the files as necessary.
