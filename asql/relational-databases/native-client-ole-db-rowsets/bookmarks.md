# Bookmarks
[!INCLUDE[SNAC_Deprecated](../../relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-reference/includes/snac-deprecated.md)]

  Bookmarks let consumers quickly return to a row. With bookmarks, consumers can access rows randomly based on the bookmark value. The bookmark column is column 0 in the rowset. The consumer sets the dwFlag field value of the binding structure to DBCOLUMNSINFO_ISBOOKMARK to indicate that the column is used as a bookmark. The consumer also sets the rowset property DBPROP_BOOKMARKS to VARIANT_TRUE. This lets column 0 be present in the rowset. The **IRowsetLocate::GetRowsAt** method is then used to fetch rows, starting with the row specified as an offset from a bookmark.
