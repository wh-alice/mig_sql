# Connect to a Microsoft Azure Subscription
Use **Connect to a Microsoft Subscription** to register an existing Azure blob container with your instance of SQL Server.  The dialog box will create a shared access signature and stored access policy on an Azure blob container and then create a SQL Server Credential.  This dialog box appears when using the Back Up or Restore task from SQL Server Management Studio and the operation involves a URL device.

## Limitation
**Connect to a Microsoft Subscription** will only work with an Azure Storage Account created through the Service Management (Classic) deployment model.  For more information regarding Azure deployment models, see [Azure Resource Manager vs. classic deployment](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/).

## Options
**Sign in**     
Sign in with the appropriate Azure account.

**Select a subscription to use**      
Select desired subscription from the drop-down list.

**Select Storage Account**  
Select desired storage account from the drop-down list.

**Select Blob Container**   
Select desired blob container from the drop-down list.

**Shared Access Policy Expiration**   
The shared access policy will expire on the given date.  The default expiration date is one year from creation.  Modify as desired.

**Shared Access Signature Generated**   
The rich text box will display the generated shared access signature.

**Create Credential**   
Button will generate a stored access policy and shared access signature and then create a SQL Server credential.
