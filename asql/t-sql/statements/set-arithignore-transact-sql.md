# SET ARITHIGNORE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Controls whether error messages are returned from overflow or divide-by-zero errors during a query.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../a9notintoc/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
-- Syntax for SQL Server and Azure SQL Database  
    
SET ARITHIGNORE { ON | OFF }  
[ ; ]  
```  
  
```  
-- Syntax for Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
SET ARITHIGNORE OFF   
[ ; ]  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The SET ARITHIGNORE setting only controls whether an error message is returned. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] returns a NULL in a calculation involving an overflow or divide-by-zero error, regardless of this setting. The SET ARITHABORT setting can be used to determine whether the query is terminated. This setting does not affect errors occurring during INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.  
  
 If either SET ARITHABORT or SET ARITHIGNORE is OFF and SET ANSI_WARNINGS is ON, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] still returns an error message when encountering divide-by-zero or overflow errors.  
  
 The setting of SET ARITHIGNORE is set at execute or run time and not at parse time.  
  
 To view the current setting for this setting, run the following query.  
  
```  
DECLARE @ARITHIGNORE VARCHAR(3) = 'OFF';  
IF ( (128 & @@OPTIONS) = 128 ) SET @ARITHIGNORE = 'ON';  
SELECT @ARITHIGNORE AS ARITHIGNORE;  
  
```  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires membership in the public role.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates using both `SET ARITHIGNORE` settings with both types of query errors.  
  
```  
SET ARITHABORT OFF;  
SET ANSI_WARNINGS OFF  
GO  
  
PRINT 'Setting ARITHIGNORE ON';  
GO  
-- SET ARITHIGNORE ON and testing.  
SET ARITHIGNORE ON;  
GO  
SELECT 1 / 0 AS DivideByZero;  
GO  
SELECT CAST(256 AS TINYINT) AS Overflow;  
GO  
  
PRINT 'Setting ARITHIGNORE OFF';  
GO  
-- SET ARITHIGNORE OFF and testing.  
SET ARITHIGNORE OFF;  
GO  
SELECT 1 / 0 AS DivideByZero;  
GO  
SELECT CAST(256 AS TINYINT) AS Overflow;  
GO  
```  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../a9notintoc/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../a9notintoc/includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
 The following example demonstrates the divide by zero and the overflow errors. This example does not return an error message for these errors because ARITHIGNORE is OFF.  
  
```  
-- SET ARITHIGNORE OFF and testing.  
SET ARITHIGNORE OFF;  
SELECT 1 / 0 AS DivideByZero;  
SELECT CAST(256 AS TINYINT) AS Overflow;  
  
```
