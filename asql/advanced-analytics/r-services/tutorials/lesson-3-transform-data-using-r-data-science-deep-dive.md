# Lesson 3: Transform Data Using R (Data Science Deep Dive)
The **RevoScaleR** package provides multiple functions for transforming data at various stages of your analysis:  
  
-   **rxDataStep** can be used to create and transform subsets of data.  
  
-   **rxImport** supports transforming data as data is being imported to or from an XDF file or an in-memory data frame.  
  
-   Although not specifically for data movement, the functions **rxSummary**, **rxCube**, **rxLinMod**, and **rxLogit** all support data transformations.  
  
In this section, you'll learn how to use these functions. Let's start with  *rxDataStep*.  
  
## Use rxDataStep to Transform Variables  
The *rxDataStep* function processes data one chunk at a time, reading from one data source and writing to another. You can specify the columns to transform, the transformations to load, and so forth.  
  
To make this example interesting, youâ€™ll use a function from another R package to transform your data.  The **boot** package is one of the "recommended" packages, meaning that **boot** is included with every distribution of R, but is not loaded automatically on start-up. Therefore, the package should already be available on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance that you've been using with [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-productname-md.md)].  
  
From the **boot** package, you'll use the  function *inv.logit*, which computes the inverse of a logit. That is, the *inv.logit* function converts a logit back to a probability on the [0,1] scale.  
  
> [!TIP]  
> Another way to  get predictions in this scale would be to set the *type* parameter to **response** in the original call to *rxPredict*.  
  
1.  Start by creating a data source to hold the data destined for the table, *ccScoreOutput*.  
  
    ```R  
    sqlOutScoreDS <- RxSqlServerData( table =  "ccScoreOutput",  connectionString = sqlConnString, rowsPerRead = sqlRowsPerRead )  
  
    ```  
  
2.  Add another data source to hold the data for the table ccScoreOutput2.  
  
    ```R  
    sqlOutScoreDS2 <- RxSqlServerData( table =  "ccScoreOutput2",  connectionString = sqlConnString, rowsPerRead = sqlRowsPerRead )  
  
    ```  
  
    In the new table, you will get all the variables from the previous *ccScoreOutput* table, plus the newly created variable.  
  
3.  Set the compute context to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.  
  
    ```R  
    rxSetComputeContext(sqlCompute)  
  
    ```  
  
4.  Use the function *rxSqlServerTableExists* to check whether the output table *ccScoreOutput2* already exists, and if so, use the function *rxSqlServerDropTable* to delete the table.  
  
    ```R    
    if (rxSqlServerTableExists("ccScoreOutput2"))     rxSqlServerDropTable("ccScoreOutput2")  
  
    ```  
  
5.  Call the *rxDataStep* function, and specify the desired transforms in a list.  
  
    ```R  
    rxDataStep(inData = sqlOutScoreDS,   
        outFile = sqlOutScoreDS2,         
        transforms = list(ccFraudProb = inv.logit(ccFraudLogitScore)),        
        transformPackages = "boot",   
        overwrite = TRUE)    
    ```  
  
    When you define the transformations that are applied to each column, you can also specify any additional R packages that are needed to perform the transformations.  For more information about the types of transformations that you can perform, see  [Transforming and Subsetting Data](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/scaler-user-guide-data-transform)
  
6.  Call *rxGetVarInfo* to view a summary of the variables in the new data set.  
  
    ```R  
    rxGetVarInfo(sqlOutScoreDS2)  
    ```  
  
**Results**  
  
*Var 1: ccFraudLogitScore, Type: numeric*  
*Var 2: state, Type: character*  
*Var 3: gender, Type: character*  
*Var 4: cardholder, Type: character*  
*Var 5: balance, Type: integer*  
*Var 6: numTrans, Type: integer*  
*Var 7: numIntlTrans, Type: integer*  
*Var 8: creditLine, Type: integer*  
*Var 9: ccFraudProb, Type: numeric*  
  
The original logit scores are preserved, but a new column, *ccFraudProb*, has been added, in which the logit scores are represented as values between 0 and 1. 

Notice that the factor variables have been written to the table *ccScoreOutput2* as character data.  To use them as factors in subsequent analyses, use the parameter *colInfo* to specify the levels.
