# Troubleshoot SQL Server Resource Health (SQL Server Utility)
  Troubleshooting resource health issues identified by a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] UCP might include mitigating overutilized CPU on a computer or on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], or mitigating overutilized CPU for a data-tier application. Other issues might include resolving overutilized file space for database files or resolving overutilization of allocated disk space on a storage volume.  
  
 Note that if a database is in “emergency” state, the health state will display overutilized log file space.
