# sys.dm_tran_active_snapshot_database_transactions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  In a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance, this dynamic management view returns a virtual table for all active transactions that generate or potentially access row versions. Transactions are included for one or more of the following conditions:  
  
-   When either or both ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION and READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT database options are set to ON:  
  
    -   There is one row for each transaction that is running under snapshot isolation level, or read-committed isolation level that is using row versioning.  
  
    -   There is one row for each transaction that causes a row version to be created in the current database. For example, the transaction generates a row version by updating or deleting a row in the current database.  
  
-   When a trigger is fired, there is one row for the transaction under which the trigger is executing.  
  
-   When an online indexing procedure is running, there is one row for the transaction that is creating the index.  
  
-   When Multiple Active Results Sets (MARS) session is enabled, there is one row for each transaction that is accessing row versions.  
  
 This dynamic management view does not include system transactions.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To call this from [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name **sys.dm_pdw_nodes_tran_active_snapshot_database_transactions**.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sys.dm_tran_active_snapshot_database_transactions  
```  
  
## Table Returned  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**transaction_id**|**bigint**|Unique identification number assigned for the transaction. The transaction ID is primarily used to identify the transaction in locking operations.|  
|**transaction_sequence_num**|**bigint**|Transaction sequence number. This is a unique sequence number that is assigned to a transaction when it starts. Transactions that do not generate version records and do not use snapshot scans will not receive a transaction sequence number.|  
|**commit_sequence_num**|**bigint**|Sequence number that indicates when the transaction finishes (commits or stops). For active transactions, the value is NULL.|  
|**is_snapshot**|**int**|0 = Is not a snapshot isolation transaction.<br /><br /> 1 = Is a snapshot isolation transaction.|  
|**session_id**|**int**|ID of the session that started the transaction.|  
|**first_snapshot_sequence_num**|**bigint**|Lowest transaction sequence number of the transactions that were active when a snapshot was taken. On execution, a snapshot transaction takes a snapshot of all of the active transactions at that time. For nonsnapshot transactions, this column shows 0.|  
|**max_version_chain_traversed**|**int**|Maximum length of the version chain that is traversed to find the transactionally consistent version.|  
|**average_version_chain_traversed**|**real**|Average number of row versions in the version chains that are traversed.|  
|**elapsed_time_seconds**|**bigint**|Elapsed time since the transaction obtained its transaction sequence number.|  
|**pdw_node_id**|**int**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)]<br /><br /> The identifier for the node that this distribution is on.|  
  
## Permissions  
 On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] requires VIEW SERVER STATE permission on the server.  
  
 On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] Premium Tiers requires the VIEW DATABASE STATE permission in the database. On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] Standard and Basic Tiers requires the [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] admin account.  
  
## Remarks  
 **sys.dm_tran_active_snapshot_database_transactions** reports transactions that are assigned a transaction sequence number (XSN). The XSN is assigned when the transaction first accesses the version store. In a database that is enabled for snapshot isolation or read committed isolation using row versioning, the examples show when an XSN is assigned to a transaction:  
  
-   If a transaction is running under serializable isolation level, an XSN is assigned when the transaction first executes a statement, such as an UPDATE operation, that causes a row version to be created.  
  
-   If a transaction is running under snapshot isolation, an XSN is assigned when any data manipulation language (DML) statement, including a SELECT operation, is executed.  
  
 Transaction sequence numbers are serially incremented for each transaction that is started in an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses a test scenario in which four concurrent transactions, each identified by a transaction sequence number (XSN), are running in a database that has the ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION and READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT options set to ON. The following transactions are running:  
  
-   XSN-57 is an update operation under serializable isolation.  
  
-   XSN-58 is the same as XSN-57.  
  
-   XSN-59 is a select operation under snapshot isolation  
  
-   XSN-60 is same as XSN-59.  
  
 The following query is executed.  
  
```  
SELECT   
    transaction_id,  
    transaction_sequence_num,  
    commit_sequence_num,  
    is_snapshot session_id,  
    first_snapshot_sequence_num,  
    max_version_chain_traversed,  
    average_version_chain_traversed,  
    elapsed_time_seconds  
  FROM sys.dm_tran_active_snapshot_database_transactions;  
```

 The following information evaluates the results from **sys.dm_tran_active_snapshot_database_transactions**:  
  
-   XSN-57: Because this transaction is not running under snapshot isolation, the `is_snapshot` value and `first_snapshot_sequence_num` are `0`. `transaction_sequence_num` shows that a transaction sequence number has been assigned to this transaction, because one or both ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION or READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT database options are ON.  
  
-   XSN-58: This transaction is not running under snapshot isolation and the same information for XSN-57 applies.  
  
-   XSN-59: This is the first active transaction that is running under snapshot isolation. This transaction reads data that is committed before XSN-57, as indicated by `first_snapshot_sequence_num`. The output for this transaction also shows the maximum version chain that is traversed for a row is `1` and has traversed an average of `1` version for each row that is accessed. This means that transactions XSN-57, XSN-58, and XSN-60 have not modified rows and committed.  
  
-   XSN-60: This is the second transaction running under snapshot isolation. The output shows the same information as XSN-59.
