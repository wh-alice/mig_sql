# SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to SQL Database. SSMS provides tools to configure, monitor, and administer instances of SQL from wherever you deploy it. SSMS provides tools to deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components, such as databases and data warehouses used by your applications, and to build queries and scripts. 

SSMS is part of a suite of developer tools Microsoft offers free of charge for your development needs.
