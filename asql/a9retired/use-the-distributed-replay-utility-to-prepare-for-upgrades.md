# Use the Distributed Replay Utility to Prepare for Upgrades
  The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay Utility can use multiple computers to replay trace data, simulating a mission-critical workload. By performing a replay on a test server before and after a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] upgrade, you can measure performance differences and look for any incompatibilities your application may have with the upgrade. For more information, see [SQL Server Distributed Replay](../tools/distributed-replay/sql-server-distributed-replay.md).
