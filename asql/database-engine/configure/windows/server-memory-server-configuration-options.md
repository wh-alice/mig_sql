# Server Memory Server Configuration Options
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Use the two server memory options, **min server memory** and **max server memory**, to reconfigure the amount of memory (in megabytes) that is managed by the SQL Server Memory Manager for a SQL Server process used by an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 The default setting for **min server memory** is 0, and the default setting for **max server memory** is 2147483647 MB. By default, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can change its memory requirements dynamically based on available system resources.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Setting **max server memory** to the minimum value can severely reduce [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] performance and even prevent it from starting. If you cannot start [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] after changing this option, start it using the **–f** startup option and reset **max server memory** to its previous value. For more information, see [Database Engine Service Startup Options](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/database-engine-service-startup-options.md).  
  
 When [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is using memory dynamically, it queries the system periodically to determine the amount of free memory. Maintaining this free memory prevents the operating system (OS) from paging. If less memory is free, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] releases memory to the OS. If more memory is free, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] may allocate more memory. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] adds memory only when its workload requires more memory; a server at rest does not increase the size of its virtual address space.  
  
 See example B for a query to return the currently used memory. **max server memory** controls the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] memory allocation, including the buffer pool, compile memory, all caches, qe memory grants, lock manager memory, and clr memory (essentially any memory clerk found in **sys.dm_os_memory_clerks**). Memory for thread stacks, memory heaps, linked server providers other than [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and any memory allocated by a non [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] DLL are not controlled by max server memory.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses the memory notification API **QueryMemoryResourceNotification** to determine when the SQL Server Memory Manager may allocate memory and release memory.  
  
 Allowing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to use memory dynamically is recommended; however, you can set the memory options manually and restrict the amount of memory that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can access. Before you set the amount of memory for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], determine the appropriate memory setting by subtracting, from the total physical memory, the memory required for the OS and any other instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (and other system uses, if the computer is not wholly dedicated to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]). This difference is the maximum amount of memory you can assign to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Setting the Memory Options Manually  
 Set **min server memory** and **max server memory** to span a range of memory values. This method is useful for system or database administrators to configure an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in conjunction with the memory requirements of other applications that run on the same computer.  
  
 Use **min server memory** to guarantee a minimum amount of memory available to the SQL Server Memory Manager for an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will not immediately allocate the amount of memory specified in **min server memory** on startup. However, after memory usage has reached this value due to client load, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cannot free memory unless the value of **min server memory** is reduced.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is not guaranteed to allocate the amount of memory specified in **min server memory**. If the load on the server never requires allocating the amount of memory specified in **min server memory**, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will run with less memory.  
  
 The minimum memory amount allowable for **max server memory** is 128 MB.  
  
## How to configure memory options using SQL Server Management Studio  
 Use the two server memory options, **min server memory** and **max server memory**, to reconfigure the amount of memory (in megabytes) managed by the SQL Server Memory Manager for an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. By default, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can change its memory requirements dynamically based on available system resources.  
  
### Procedure for configuring a fixed amount of memory  
 To set a fixed amount of memory  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, right-click a server and select **Properties**.  
  
2.  Click the **Memory** node.  
  
3.  Under **Server Memory Options**, enter the amount that you want for **Minimum server memory** and **Maximum server memory**.  
  
     Use the default settings to allow [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to change its memory requirements dynamically based on available system resources. The default setting for **min server memory** is 0, and the default setting for **max server memory** is 2147483647 megabytes (MB).  
  
## Maximize Data Throughput for Network Applications  
 To optimize system memory use for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you should limit the amount of memory that is used by the system for file caching. To limit the file system cache, make sure that **Maximize data throughput for file sharing** is not selected. You can specify the smallest file system cache by selecting **Minimize memory used** or **Balance**.  
  
#### To check the current setting on your operating system  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, double-click **Network Connections**, and then double-click **Local Area Connection**.  
  
2.  On the **General** tab, click **Properties**, select **File and Printer Sharing Microsoft Networks**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  If **Maximize data throughput for network applications** is selected, choose any other option, click **OK**, and then close the rest of the dialog boxes.  
  
## Lock Pages in Memory  
 This Windows policy determines which accounts can use a process to keep data in physical memory, preventing the system from paging the data to virtual memory on disk. Locking pages in memory may keep the server responsive when paging memory to disk occurs. The SQL Server **Lock Pages in Memory** option is set to ON in instances of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Standard edition and higher when the account with privileges to run sqlservr.exe has been granted the Windows "Locked Pages in Memory” (LPIM) user right.  
  
 To disable the **Lock Pages In Memory** option for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], remove the “Locked Pages in Memory” user right for the SQL Server startup account.  
  
### To Disable Lock Pages in Memory  
 To disable the lock pages in memory option  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**. In the **Open** box, type **gpedit.msc**.  
  
     The **Group Policy** dialog box opens.  
  
2.  On the **Group Policy** console, expand **Computer Configuration**, and then expand **Windows Settings**.  
  
3.  Expand **Security Settings**, and then expand **Local Policies**.  
  
4.  Select the **User Rights Assignment** folder.  
  
     The policies will be displayed in the details pane.  
  
5.  In the pane, double-click **Lock pages in memory**.  
  
6.  In the **Local Security Policy Setting** dialog box, select the account with privileges to run sqlservr.exe and click **Remove**.  
  
## Virtual Memory Manager  
 The committed regions of address space are mapped to the available physical memory by the Windows Virtual Memory Manager (VMM).  
  
 For more information on the amount of physical memory supported by different operating systems, see the Windows documentation "Memory Limits for Windows Releases".  
  
 Virtual memory systems allow the over-commitment of physical memory, so that the ratio of virtual-to-physical memory can exceed 1:1. As a result, larger programs can run on computers with a variety of physical memory configurations. However, using significantly more virtual memory than the combined average working sets of all the processes can cause poor performance.  
  
 The **min server memory** and **max server memory** options are advanced options. If you are using the **sp_configure** system stored procedure to change these settings, you can change them only when **show advanced options** is set to 1. These settings take effect immediately without a server restart.  
  
## Running Multiple Instances of SQL Server  
 When you are running multiple instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)], there are three approaches you can use to manage memory:  
  
-   Use **max server memory** to control memory usage. Establish maximum settings for each instance, being careful that the total allowance is not more than the total physical memory on your machine. You might want to give each instance memory proportional to its expected workload or database size. This approach has the advantage that when new processes or instances start up, free memory will be available to them immediately. The drawback is that if you are not running all of the instances, none of the running instances will be able to utilize the remaining free memory.  
  
-   Use **min server memory** to control memory usage. Establish minimum settings for each instance, so that the sum of these minimums is 1-2 GB less than the total physical memory on your machine. Again, you may establish these minimums proportionately to the expected load of that instance. This approach has the advantage that if not all instances are running at the same time, the ones that are running can use the remaining free memory. This approach is also useful when there is another memory-intensive process on the computer, since it would insure that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] would at least get a reasonable amount of memory. The drawback is that when a new instance (or any other process) starts, it may take some time for the running instances to release memory, especially if they must write modified pages back to their databases to do so.  
  
-   Do nothing (not recommended). The first instances presented with a workload will tend to allocate all of memory. Idle instances, or instances started later, may end up running with only a minimal amount of memory available. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] makes no attempt to balance memory usage across instances. All instances will, however, respond to Windows Memory Notification signals to adjust the size of their memory footprint. Windows does not balance memory across applications with the Memory Notification API. It merely provides global feedback as to the availability of memory on the system.  
  
 You can change these settings without restarting the instances, so you can easily experiment to find the best settings for your usage pattern.  
  
## Providing the Maximum Amount of Memory to SQL Server  
 Memory can be configured up to the process virtual address space limit in all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] editions (8 TB).  
  
 ***/3gb** is an operating-system boot parameter. For more information, visit the [MSDN Library](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=10257&clcid=0x409).  
  
## Examples  
  
### Example A  
 The following example sets the `max server memory` option to 4 GB:  
  
```  
sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;  
GO  
RECONFIGURE;  
GO  
sp_configure 'max server memory', 4096;  
GO  
RECONFIGURE;  
GO  
```  
  
### Example B. Determining Current Memory Allocation  
 The following query returns information about currently allocated memory.  
  
```  
SELECT  
(physical_memory_in_use_kb/1024) AS Memory_usedby_Sqlserver_MB,  
(locked_page_allocations_kb/1024) AS Locked_pages_used_Sqlserver_MB,  
(total_virtual_address_space_kb/1024) AS Total_VAS_in_MB,  
process_physical_memory_low,  
process_virtual_memory_low  
FROM sys.dm_os_process_memory;  
```
