# Display Percentage Values on a Pie Chart (Report Builder and SSRS)
In [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] paginated reports, by default the legend shows categories. You may also want percentages in the legend or the pie slices themselves.

 The [Tutorial: Add a Pie Chart to Your Report (Report Builder)](Tutorial:%20Add%20a%20Pie%20Chart%20to%20Your%20Report%20\(Report%20Builder\).md) walks you through adding percentages to pie slices, if you'd like to try this with sample data first.
 
  
## To display percentage values as labels on a pie chart  
  
1.  Add a pie chart to your report. For more information, see [Add a Chart to a Report &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/add-a-chart-to-a-report-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
2.  On the design surface, right-click on the pie and select **Show Data Labels**. The data labels should appear within each slice on the pie chart.  
  
3.  On the design surface, right-click on the labels and select **Series Label Properties**. The **Series Label Properties** dialog box appears.  
  
4.  Type **#PERCENT** for the **Label data** option.  
  
5.  (Optional) To specify how many decimal places the label shows, type "#PERCENT{P*n*}" where *n* is the number of decimal places to display. For example, to display no decimal places, type "#PERCENT{P0}".  
  
## To display percentage values in the legend of a pie chart  
  
1.  On the design surface, right-click on the pie chart and select **Series Properties**. The **Series Properties** dialog box displays.  
  
2.  In **Legend**, type **#PERCENT** for the **Custom legend text** property.
