# Inferred Dimension Members (Slowly Changing Dimension Wizard)
  Use the **Inferred Dimension Members** dialog box to specify options for using inferred members. Inferred members exist when a fact table references dimension members that are not yet loaded. When data for the inferred member is loaded, you can update the existing record rather than create a new one.  
  
 To learn more about this wizard, see [Slowly Changing Dimension Transformation](../../../integration-services/data-flow/transformations/slowly-changing-dimension-transformation.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Enable inferred member support**  
 If you choose to enable inferred members, you must select one of the two options that follow.  
  
 **All columns with a change type are null**  
 Specify whether to enter null values in all columns with a change type in the new inferred member record.  
  
 **Use a Boolean column to indicate whether the current record is an inferred member**  
 Specify whether to use an existing Boolean column to indicate whether the current record is an inferred member.  
  
 **Inferred member indicator**  
 If you have chosen to use a Boolean column to indicate inferred members as described above, select the column from the list.
