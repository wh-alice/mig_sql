# Administrative Password
  If, on the **Distributors** page of this wizard, you selected a remote Distributor for this Publisher, you must enter a password for the connection replication makes between the Publisher and the Distributor using the **distributor_admin** login. The password must match the password specified on the **Distributor Password** page of the Configure Distribution Wizard or the **Publishers** page of the **Distributor Properties** dialog box.  
  
## Options  
 **Password**  
 Enter the password for the connection between the Publisher and the remote Distributor.  
  
 **Confirm Password**  
 Re-enter the password to confirm it was entered correctly.
