# Z (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  The Z (elevation) value of the instance. The semantics of the elevation value are user-defined.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.Z  
```  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] type: **float**  
  
 CLR type: **SqlDouble**  
  
## Remarks  
 The value of this property is null if the **geography** instance is not a point, as well as for any **Point** instance for which it is not set.  
  
 This property is read-only.  
  
 Z-coordinates are not used in any calculations made by the library and are not carried through any library calculations.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates a `Point` instance with Z (elevation) and M (measure) values and uses `Z` to fetch the Z value of the instance.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('POINT(-122.34900 47.65100 10.3 12)', 4326);  
SELECT @g.Z;  
```
