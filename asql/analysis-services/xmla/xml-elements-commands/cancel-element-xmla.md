# Cancel Element (XMLA)
  Cancels a currently running command an [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
  
<Command>  
   <Cancel>  
      <ConnectionID>...</ConnectionID>

      <SPID>...</SPID>  
      <CancelAssociated>...</CancelAssociated>  
   </Cancel>

## Remarks  
 The **Cancel** command cancels currently executing commands within the context of a session. If the client application has not requested a session, a command cannot be canceled.  
  
 If the **Cancel** command is executed during the execution of a **Batch** command, the entire **Batch** command is canceled. If the **Batch** command was transactional, all of the commands contained by the **Batch** command are rolled back. If the **Batch** command was not transactional, only those commands contained by the **Batch** command that were executing at the time the **Cancel** command was executed are rolled back. Commands in a non-transactional **Batch** command that had already executed would not be rolled back.  
  
 Typically, the **Cancel** command is used to cancel executing commands on the currently active session. In that case, none of the child elements for the **Cancel** command must be specified. The **Cancel** command can also be used by administrators to cancel commands executing on connections or sessions other than the currently active session. Members of a role that has Administer permissions for a given database can cancel commands for connections and sessions applicable to that database, while server administrators can cancel commands for connections and sessions for a given Analysis Services instance.  
  
 To retrieve information about current connections and sessions for an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance, the **Discover** method can be executed to request, respectively, the DISCOVER_CONNECTIONS and DISCOVER_SESSIONS schema rowsets. Members of a role that has Administer permissions for a given database can return sessions only for a given database by specifying that database in the SESSION_CURRENT_DATABASE restriction column for the DISCOVER_SESSIONS schema rowset. For more information about the **Discover** method, see [Discover Method &#40;XMLA&#41;](../Topic/Discover%20Method%20\(XMLA\).md).
