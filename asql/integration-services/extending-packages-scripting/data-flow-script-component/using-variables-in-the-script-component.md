# Using Variables in the Script Component
  Variables store values that a package and its containers, tasks, and event handlers can use at run time. For more information, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Variables](../../../integration-services/integration-services-ssis-variables.md).  
  
 You can make existing variables available for read-only or read/write access by your custom script by entering comma-delimited lists of variables in the **ReadOnlyVariables** and **ReadWriteVariables** fields on the **Script** page of the **Script Transformation Editor**. Keep in mind that variable names are case-sensitive. Use the **Value** property to read from and write to individual variables. The Script component handles any required locking behind the scenes as your script manipulates the variables at run time.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The collection of **ReadWriteVariables** is only available in the **PostExecute** method to maximize performance and minimize the risk of locking conflicts. Therefore you cannot directly increment the value of a package variable as you process each row of data. Increment the value of a local variable instead, and set the value of the package variable to the value of the local variable in the **PostExecute** method after all data has been processed. You can also use the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.ScriptComponent.VariableDispenser%2A> property to work around this limitation, as described later in this topic. However, writing directly to a package variable as each row is processed will negatively impact performance and increase the risk of locking conflicts.  
  
 For more information about the **Script** page of the **Script Transformation Editor**, see [Configuring the Script Component in the Script Component Editor](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting/data-flow-script-component/configuring-the-script-component-in-the-script-component-editor.md) and [Script Transformation Editor &#40;Script Page&#41;](../../../integration-services/data-flow/transformations/script-transformation-editor-script-page.md).  
  
 The Script component creates a **Variables** collection class in the **ComponentWrapper** project item with a strongly-typed accessor property for the value of each preconfigured variable where the property has the same name as the variable itself. This collection is exposed through the **Variables** property of the **ScriptMain** class. The accessor property provides read-only or read/write permission to the value of the variable as appropriate. For example, if you have added an integer variable named `MyIntegerVariable` to the **ReadOnlyVariables** list, you can retrieve its value in your script by using the following code:  
  
 `Dim myIntegerVariableValue As Integer = Me.Variables.MyIntegerVariable`  
  
 You can also use the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.ScriptComponent.VariableDispenser%2A> property, accessed by calling `Me.VariableDispenser`, to work with variables in the Script component. In this case you are not using the typed and named accessor properties for variables, but accessing the variables directly. When using the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.ScriptComponent.VariableDispenser%2A>, you must handle both the locking semantics and the casting of data types for variable values in your own code. You have to use the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.ScriptComponent.VariableDispenser%2A> property instead of the named and typed accessor properties if you want to work with a variable that is not available at design time but is created programmatically at run time.
