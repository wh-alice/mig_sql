# sp_helppublication (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns information about a publication. For a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] publication, this stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database. For an Oracle publication, this stored procedure is executed at the Distributor on any database.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_helppublication [ [ @publication = ] 'publication' ]  
    [ , [ @found=] found OUTPUT]  
    [ , [ @publisher = ] 'publisher' ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@publication =** ] **'***publication***'**  
 Is the name of the publication to be viewed. *publication* is sysname, with a default of **%**, which returns information about all publications.  
  
 [ **@found =** ] **'***found***'** OUTPUT  
 Is a flag to indicate returning rows. *found*is **int** and an OUTPUT parameter, with a default of **23456**. **1** indicates the publication is found. **0** indicates the publication is not found.  
  
 [ **@publisher** = ] **'***publisher***'**  
 Specifies a non-[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] publisher. *publisher* is sysname, with a default of NULL.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  *publisher* should not be specified when requesting publication information from a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Publisher.

A value of **1** means that the agent continues to process changes.<br /><br /> **\*\* Caution \*\*** We recommend that you use the default value of **0**.

This method does not guarantee convergence. You should make sure that the topology is consistent after a conflict is detected.
