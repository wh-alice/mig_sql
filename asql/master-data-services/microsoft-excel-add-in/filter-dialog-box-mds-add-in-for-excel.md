# Filter Dialog Box (MDS Add-in for Excel)
  In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)], use the **Filter** dialog box to narrow the list of MDS-managed data before loading it into Excel.  
  
 This dialog box contains three sections: **Columns**, **Rows**, and **Summary**.  
  
## Columns  
 Use the **Columns** section to determine which attributes (columns) you want to display in Excel.  
  
|Control Name|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|Attribute type|An attribute type describes the type of members you want to work with. In most cases, this is **Leaf**. For more information about member types, see [Members &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/members-master-data-services.md).|  
|Explicit hierarchy|If you chose the **Consolidated** attribute type, choose the hierarchy the consolidated members belong to. For more information, see [Explicit Hierarchies &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/explicit-hierarchies-master-data-services.md).|  
|Attribute Groups|Attribute groups are a way of grouping subsets of attributes. Choose an attribute group if you want to show a subset of available attributes. For more information about attribute groups, see [Attribute Groups &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/attribute-groups-master-data-services.md).|  
|Select All|Click to select all attributes displayed in the list.|  
|Clear All|Click to clear the selected attributes displayed in the list.<br /><br /> You cannot clear **Name** and **Code**.|  
|Up Arrow/Down Arrow|Click to move the selected attribute up and down in the list. The top-to-bottom order corresponds to the left-to-right order the columns are displayed in the worksheet.|  
  
## Rows  
 Use the **Rows** section to determine which members (rows) you want to display in Excel. You do this by defining criteria to filter the rows that will be displayed.  
  
|Control Name|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|Attribute|Displays an attribute you want to filter by. If no attributes are listed, it’s because they have not been added.<br /><br /> Note: You can filter by attributes that you don’t plan to show in the worksheet.|  
|Operator|Displays operators that correspond to the type of attribute that was selected. For more information, see [Filter Operators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/filter-operators-master-data-services.md).|  
|Criteria|The criteria you want to filter by.|  
|Update Summary|When working with large datasets, click to update the **Summary** section with details of the amount of data that will be loaded.|  
|Add|When you click an attribute in the **Columns** section and then click **Add**, an attribute is added to the list of filters.|  
|Remove All|Removes all filters from the list.|  
|Remove|Removes selected filter from the list.|  
  
## Summary  
 Use the **Summary** section to view details about the amount of data that will be loaded, before loading it.  
  
|Control Name|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|Model|The name of the model.|  
|Version|The name of the version.|  
|Entity|The name of the entity.|  
|Rows|The number of rows that will be loaded into Excel, based on the filters applied in the **Rows** section.|  
|Columns|The number of columns that will be loaded into Excel, based on the attributes selected in the **Columns** section.|
