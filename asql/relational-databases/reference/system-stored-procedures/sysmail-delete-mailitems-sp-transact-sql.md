[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

 ![Topic link icon](../../../a9notintoc/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sysmail_delete_mailitems_sp  [ [ @sent_before = ] 'sent_before' ]  
    [ , [ @sent_status = ] 'sent_status' ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@sent_before=** ] **'***sent_before***'**  
 Deletes e-mails up to the date and time provided as the *sent_before* argument. *sent_before* is **datetime** with NULL as default. NULL indicates all dates.  
  
 [ **@sent_status=** ] **'***sent_status***'**  
 Deletes e-mails of the type specified by *sent_status*. *sent_status* is **varchar(8)** with no default. Valid entries are **sent**, **unsent**, **retrying**, and **failed**. NULL indicates all statuses.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 Database Mail messages and their attachments are stored in the **msdb** database. Messages should be periodically deleted to prevent **msdb** from growing larger than expected and to comply with your organizations document retention program. Use the **sysmail_delete_mailitems_sp** stored procedure to permanently delete e-mail messages from the Database Mail tables. An optional argument allows you to delete only older e-mails by providing a date and time. E-mails older than that argument will be deleted. Another optional argument allows you to delete only e-mails of a certain type, specified as the **sent_status** argument. You must provide an argument either for **@sent_before** or **@sent_status**. To delete all messages, use **@sent_before = getdate()**.  
  
 Deleting e-mail also deletes attachments related to those messages. Deleting e-mail does not delete the corresponding entries in **sysmail_event_log**. Use [sysmail_delete_log_sp](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sysmail-delete-log-sp-transact-sql.md) to delete items from the log.  
  
## Permissions  
 By default, this stored procedure is granted for execution to members off the **sysadmin** fixed server role and **DatabaseMailUserRole**. Members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can execute this procedure to delete e-mails sent by all users. Members of **DatabaseMailUserRole** can only delete e-mails sent by that user.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Deleting all e-mails  
 The following example deletes all e-mails in the Database Mail system.  
  
```  
DECLARE @GETDATE datetime  
SET @GETDATE = GETDATE();  
EXECUTE msdb.dbo.sysmail_delete_mailitems_sp @sent_before = @GETDATE;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Deleting the oldest e-mails  
 The following example deletes e-mails in the Database Mail log that are older than `October 9, 2005`.  
  
```  
EXECUTE msdb.dbo.sysmail_delete_mailitems_sp   
    @sent_before = 'October 9, 2005' ;  
GO  
```  
  
### C. Deleting all e-mails of a certain type  
 The following example deletes all failed e-mails in the Database Mail log.  
  
```  
EXECUTE msdb.dbo.sysmail_delete_mailitems_sp   
    @sent_status = 'failed' ;  
GO  
```
