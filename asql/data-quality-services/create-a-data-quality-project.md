# Create a Data Quality Project
  This topic describes how to create a data quality project by using [!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../a9retired/includes/ssdqsclient-md.md)]. A data quality project is used to run the cleansing or matching activity in [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../a9retired/includes/ssdqsnoversion-md.md)] (DQS).  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites  
 You must have a relevant knowledge base to use in the data quality project for the cleansing or matching activity.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security

 You must have the dqs_kb_editor or dqs_kb_operator role on the DQS_MAIN database to create a data quality project.
