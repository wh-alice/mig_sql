# @@CONNECTIONS (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns the number of attempted connections, either successful or unsuccessful since [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] was last started.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
@@CONNECTIONS  
```  
  
## Return Types  
 **integer**  
  
## Remarks  
 Connections are different from users. Applications, for example, can open multiple connections to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] without the user observing the connections.  
  
 To display a report containing several [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] statistics, including connection attempts, run **sp_monitor**.  
  
 @@MAX_CONNECTIONS is the maximum number of connections allowed simultaneously to the server. @@CONNECTIONS is incremented with each login attempt, therefore @@CONNECTIONS can be greater than @@MAX_CONNECTIONS.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows returning the number of login attempts as of the current date and time.  
  
```  
SELECT GETDATE() AS 'Today''s Date and Time',   
@@CONNECTIONS AS 'Login Attempts';  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
```  
  
Today's Date and Time  Login Attempts
