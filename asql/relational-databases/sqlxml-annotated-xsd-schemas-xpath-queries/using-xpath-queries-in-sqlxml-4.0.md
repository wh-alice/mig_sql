# Using XPath Queries in SQLXML 4.0
  Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] support for annotated XSD schemas allows you to create XML views of the relational data stored in the database. You can use a subset of the XPath language to query the XML views created by an annotated XSD schema.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To understand XPath queries in SQLXML 4.0, you must be familiar with XML views and related concepts such as templates and mapping schema. For more information, see [Introduction to Annotated XSD Schemas &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../relational-databases/sqlxml/annotated-xsd-schemas/introduction-to-annotated-xsd-schemas-sqlxml-4.0.md). For more information about XPath, see the XPath standard defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Introduction to Using XPath Queries &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-xpath-queries/introduction-to-using-xpath-queries-sqlxml-4.0.md)  
 Provides introductory information about XPath queries in SQLXML 4.0, including supported and unsupported functionality from the W3C XPath specification.  
  
 [Specifying a Location Path &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-xpath-queries/location-path/specifying-a-location-path-sqlxml-4.0.md)  
 Describes how to specify location paths in XPath queries.  
  
 [Sample XPath Queries &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-xpath-queries/samples/sample-xpath-queries-sqlxml-4.0.md)  
 Provides sample XPath queries for SQLXML 4.0.  
  
 [XPath Data Types &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-xpath-queries/xpath-data-types-sqlxml-4.0.md)  
 Describes XPath data types, which are significantly different from those of both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and XSD.
