# backupset (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-pdw_md](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-pdw-md.md)]

  Contains a row for each backup set. A *backup set* contains the backup from a single, successful backup operation. RESTORE, RESTORE FILELISTONLY, RESTORE HEADERONLY, and RESTORE VERIFYONLY statements operate on a single backup set within the media set on the specified backup device or devices.  
  
 This table is stored in the **msdb** database.

## Remarks  
 RESTORE VERIFYONLY FROM *backup_device* WITH LOADHISTORY populates the column of the **backupmediaset** table with the appropriate values from the media-set header.  
  
 To reduce the number of rows in this table and in other backup and history tables, execute the [sp_delete_backuphistory](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-delete-backuphistory-transact-sql.md) stored procedure.
