# Log File Viewer
  Log File Viewer in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] is used to access information about errors and events that are captured in log files.  
  
## Benefits of using Log File Viewer  
 You can view [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] log files from a local or remote instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] when the target instance is offline or cannot start. You can access the offline log files from Registered Servers, or programmatically through WMI and WQL (WMI Query Language) queries.
