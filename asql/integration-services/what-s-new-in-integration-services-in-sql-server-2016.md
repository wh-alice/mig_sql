## Manageability  

### Better deployment

####  <a name="ssisdbupgrwiz"></a> SSISDB Upgrade Wizard  
 Run the SSISDB Upgrade Wizard to upgrade the SSIS Catalog database, SSISDB, when the database is older than the current version of the SQL Server instance. This occurs when one of the following conditions is true.  
  
-   You restored the database from an older version of SQL Server.  
  
-   You did not remove the database from an Always On Availability Group before upgrading the SQL Server instance. This prevents the automatic upgrade of the database. For more info, see [Upgrading SSISDB in an availability group](../integration-services/service/always-on-for-ssis-catalog-ssisdb.md#Upgrade).  
  
 For more info, see [Upgrade the SSIS Catalog &#40;SSISDB&#41;](../integration-services/service/upgrade-the-ssis-catalog-ssisdb.md). 

####  <a name="AlwaysOn"></a> Support for Always On in the SSIS Catalog  
 The Always On Availability Groups feature is a high-availability and disaster-recovery solution that provides an enterprise-level alternative to database mirroring. An availability group supports a failover environment for a discrete set of user databases known as availability databases that fail over together. For more information, see [Always On Availability Groups](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh510230.aspx).  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)], SSIS introduces new capabilities that let you easily deploy to a centralized SSIS Catalog (i.e. SSISDB user database). In order to provide high availability for the SSISDB database and its contents - projects, packages, execution logs, and so on - you can add the SSISDB database to an Always On Availability Group, just like any other user database. When a failover occurs, one of the secondary nodes automatically becomes the new primary node.  
  
 For a detailed overview and step-by-step instructions for enabling Always On for SSISDB, see [Always On for SSIS Catalog &#40;SSISDB&#41;](../integration-services/service/always-on-for-ssis-catalog-ssisdb.md).  

####  <a name="IncrementalDeployment"></a> Incremental package deployment  
The Incremental Package Deployment feature lets you deploy one or more packages to an existing or new project without deploying the whole project. You can incrementally deploy packages by using the following tools.  
  
-   Deployment Wizard  
  
-   SQL Server Management Studio (which uses the Deployment Wizard)  
  
-   SQL Server Data Tools (Visual Studio) (which also uses the Deployment Wizard)  
  
-   Stored procedures  
  
-   The Management Object Model (MOM) API  
  
 For more info, see [Deploy Packages to Integration Services Server](../integration-services/packages/deploy-packages-to-integration-services-server.md) .  

####  <a name="encrypted"></a> Support for Always Encrypted in the SSIS Catalog  
 SSIS already supports the Always Encrypted feature in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more info, see the following blog posts.  
  
-   [SSIS with Always Encrypted](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssis/archive/2015/12/18/ssis-with-always.aspx)  
  
-   [Lookup transformation with Always Encrypted](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssis/archive/2015/12/18/lookup-transformation-with-always-encrypted.aspx)  

### Better debugging

####  <a name="LogReader"></a> New ssis_logreader database-level role in the SSIS catalog  
 In previous versions of the SSIS catalog, only users in the **ssis_admin** role can access the views that contain logging output. There is now a new **ssis_logreader** database-level role that you can use to grant permissions to access the views that contain logging output to users who aren't administrators.  
  
 There is also a new **ssis_monitor** role. This role supports Always On and is for internal use only by the SSIS catalog.  

####  <a name="RuntimeLineage"></a> New RuntimeLineage logging level in the SSIS catalog  
 The new **RuntimeLineage** logging level in the SSIS catalog collects the data required to track lineage information in the data flow. You can parse this lineage information to map the lineage relationship between tasks. ISVs and developers  can build custom lineage mapping tools with this information. 

####  <a name="CustomLogging"></a> New custom logging level in the SSIS catalog  
 Previous versions of the SSIS catalog let you choose from four built-in logging levels when you run a package: **None, Basic, Performance, or Verbose**. [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] adds the **RuntimeLineage** logging level. In addition, you can now create and save multiple customized logging levels in the SSIS catalog, and pick the logging level to use every time you run a package. For each customized logging level,  select only the statistics and events you want to capture. Optionally include the event context to see variable values, connection strings, and task properties. For more info, see [Enable Logging for Package Execution on the SSIS Server](../integration-services/performance/enable-logging-for-package-execution-on-the-ssis-server.md). 

####  <a name="ErrorColumn"></a> Column names for errors in the data flow  
 When you redirect rows in the data flow that contain errors to an error output, the output contains a numeric identifier for the column in which the error occurred, but does not display the name of the column. There are now several ways to find or display the name of the column in which the error occurred.  
  
-   When you configure logging, select the **DiagnosticEx** event for logging. This event writes a data flow column map to the log. You can then look up the column name in this column map by using the column identifier captured by an error output. For more info, see [Error Handling in Data](../integration-services/data-flow/error-handling-in-data.md).  
  
-   In the Advanced Editor, you can see the column name for the upstream column when you view the properties of an input or output column of a data flow component.  
  
-   To see the names of the columns in which the error occurred, attach a Data Viewer to an error output.  The Data Viewer now displays both the description of the error and the name of the column in which the error occurred.  
  
-   In the Script Component or a custom data flow component, call the new <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.Wrapper.IDTSComponentMetaData130.GetIdentificationStringByID%2A> method of the IDTSComponentMetadata100 interface.  
  
 For more info about this improvement, see the following blog post by SSIS developer Bo Fan: [Error Column Improvements for SSIS Data Flow](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssis/archive/2015/11/27/error-column-improvement-for-ssis-data-flow.aspx).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  (This support has been expanded in subsequent releases. For more info, see [Expanded support for error column names](#getidstring) and [New IDTSComponentMetaData130 interface in the API](#CMD130).)  

####  <a name="getidstring"></a> Expanded support for error column names  
 The **DiagnosticEx** event now logs column information for all input and output columns, not just lineage columns. As a result we now call the output a pipeline column map instead of a pipeline lineage map.  
  
 The method GetIdentificationStringByLineageID has been renamed to <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.Wrapper.IDTSComponentMetaData130.GetIdentificationStringByID%2A>. For more info, see [Column names for errors in the data flow](#ErrorColumn).  
  
 For more info about this change and about the error column improvement, see the following updated blog post. [Error Column Improvements for SSIS Data Flow (Updated for CTP3.3)](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssis/archive/2015/11/27/error-column-improvement-for-ssis-data-flow.aspx)  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  (In RC0, this method has been moved to the new <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.Wrapper.IDTSComponentMetaData130> interface. For more info, see [New IDTSComponentMetaData130 interface in the API](#CMD130).)  

####  <a name="ServerLogLevel"></a> Support for server-wide default logging level  
 In SQL Server **Server Properties**, under the **Server logging level** property, you can now select a default server-wide logging level. You can pick from one of the built-in logging levels - basic, none, verbose, performance, or runtime lineage - or you can pick an existing customized logging level. The selected logging level applies to all packages deployed to the SSIS Catalog. It also applies by default to a SQL Agent job step that runs an SSIS package.  

####  <a name="CMD130"></a> New IDTSComponentMetaData130 interface in the API  
 The new <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.Wrapper.IDTSComponentMetaData130> interface adds new functionality in SQL Server 2016 to the existing <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.Wrapper.IDTSComponentMetaData100> interface, especially the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.Wrapper.IDTSComponentMetaData130.GetIdentificationStringByID%2A> method. (The **GetIdentificationStringByID** method is moved to the new interface from the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.Wrapper.IDTSComponentMetaData100> interface.)There are also new <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.Wrapper.IDTSInputColumn130> and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.Wrapper.IDTSOutputColumn130> interfaces, both of which provide the **LineageIdentificationString** property. For more info, see [Column names for errors in the data flow](#ErrorColumn).  

### Better package management

####  <a name="ProjectUpgrade"></a> Improved experience for project upgrade  
 When you upgrade SSIS projects from previous versions to the current version, the project-level connection managers continue to work as expected and the package layout and annotations are retained.  

####  <a name="BufferSize"></a> AutoAdjustBufferSize property automatically calculates buffer size for data flow  
 When you set the value of the new **AutoAdjustBufferSize** property to **true**, the data flow engine automatically calculates the buffer size for the data flow. For more info, see [Data Flow Performance Features](../integration-services/data-flow/data-flow-performance-features.md).  

####  <a name="Templates"></a> Reusable control flow templates  
 Save a commonly used control flow task or container to a standalone template file and reuse it multiple times in one or more packages in a project by using control flow templates. This reusability makes SSIS packages easier to design and maintain. For more info, see [Reuse Control Flow across Packages by Using Control Flow Package Parts](../integration-services/reuse-control-flow-across-packages-by-using-control-flow-package-parts.md).  

####  <a name="Parts"></a> New templates renamed as parts  
 The new reusable control flow templates released in CTP 3.0 have been renamed as control flow parts or package parts. For more info about this feature, see [Reuse Control Flow across Packages by Using Control Flow Package Parts](../integration-services/reuse-control-flow-across-packages-by-using-control-flow-package-parts.md).

 You can now use all the SSIS task and destinations that support SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) with SQL Server 2016 tabular models. The SSIS tasks have been updated to represent tabular objects instead of multidimensional objects. For example, when you select objects to process, the Analysis Services Processing Task automatically detects a Tabular model and displays a list of Tabular objects instead of showing measure groups and dimensions. The Partition Processing Destination now also shows tabular objects and supports pushing data into a partition.  
  
 The Dimension Processing Destination does not work for Tabular models with the SQL 2016 compatibility level.  The Analysis Services Processing Task and the Partition Processing Destination are all you need for tabular processing. 

####  <a name="builtinR"></a> Support for Built-in R Services  
 SSIS already supports the built-in R services in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You can use SSIS not only to extract data and load the output of analysis, but to build, run and periodically retrain R models. For more info, see the following log post. [Operationalize your machine learning project using SQL Server 2016 SSIS and R Services](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssis/archive/2016/01/12/operationalize-your-machine-learning-project-using-sql-server-2016-ssis-and-r-services.aspx). 

####  <a name="ValidateXML"></a> Rich XML validation output in the XML Task  
 Validate XML documents and get rich error output by enabling the **ValidationDetails** property of the XML Task. Before the **ValidationDetails** property was available, XML validation by the XML Task returned only a true or false result, with no information about errors or their locations. Now, when you set **ValidationDetails** to true, the output file contains detailed information about every error including the line number and the position. You can use this information to understand, locate, and fix errors in XML documents. For more info, see [Validate XML with the XML Task](../integration-services/control-flow/validate-xml-with-the-xml-task.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] introduced the **ValidationDetails** property in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../a9notintoc/includes/sssql11-md.md)] Service Pack 2. This new property was not announced or documented at that time. The **ValidationDetails** property is also available in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../a9notintoc/includes/sssql14-md.md)] and in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../a9notintoc/includes/sssql15-md.md)].
