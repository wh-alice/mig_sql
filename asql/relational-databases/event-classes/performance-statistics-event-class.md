# Performance Statistics Event Class
  The Performance Statistics event class can be used to monitor the performance of queries, stored procedures, and triggers that are executing. Each of the six event subclasses indicates an event in the lifetime of queries, stored procedures, and triggers within the system. Using the combination of these event subclasses and the associated sys.dm_exec_query_stats, sys.dm_exec_procedure_stats and sys.dm_exec_trigger_stats dynamic management views, you can reconstitute the performance history of any given query, stored procedure, or trigger.  
  
## Performance Statistics Event Class Data Columns  
 The following tables describe the event class data columns associated with each of the following event subclasses: EventSubClass 0, EventSubClass 1,EventSubClass 2,EventSubClass 3, EventSubClass 4, and EventSubClass 5.  
  
### EventSubClass 0  
  
|Data column name|Data type|Description|Column ID|Filterable|

|BigintData1|**bigint**|NULL|52|Yes|  
|BinaryData|**image**|NULL|2|Yes|  
|DatabaseID|**int**|ID of the database specified by the USE *database* statement or the default database if no USE *database* statement has been issued for a given instance. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the ServerName data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|  
|EventSequence|**int**|Sequence of a given event within the request.|51|No|  
|EventSubClass|**int**|Type of event subclass.<br /><br /> 0 = New batch SQL text that is not currently present in the cache.<br /><br /> The following EventSubClass types are generated in the trace for ad hoc batches.<br /><br /> For ad hoc batches with *n* number of queries:<br /><br /> 1 of type 0|21|Yes|
