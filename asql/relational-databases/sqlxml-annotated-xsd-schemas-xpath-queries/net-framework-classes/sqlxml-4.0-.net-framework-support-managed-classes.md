# SQLXML 4.0 .NET Framework Support - Managed Classes
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] SQLXML 4.0 supports features that allow you to write applications to access XML data from an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], bring the data into the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework environment, process the data, and send the updates back to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. 
  
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] SQLXML Managed Classes exposes the functionality of SQLXML 4.0 inside the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework. With SQLXML Managed Classes, you can write a C# application to access XML data from an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], bring the data into the .NET Framework environment, process the data, and send the updates back to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as a DiffGram to apply the updates. You must use a mapping schema when applying updates to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database using SQLXML Managed Classes. For a working sample, see [Accessing SQLXML Functionality in the .NET Environment](../../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-xpath-queries/net-framework-classes/accessing-sqlxml-functionality-in-the-.net-environment.md).  
  
 To use the SQLXML Managed Classes with SQLXML 4.0, you must install Microsoft Visual Studio.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The .NET Framework includes the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] .NET Data Provider. This provider can be used to access [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] from the .NET environment; however, it can handle only traditional SQL queries (that is, relational database queries with the exception of FOR XML queries). You cannot execute XML templates or the server-side XPath queries in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  

 For information about accessing and modifying data in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] within the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework, and about using DiffGrams to update data in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tables, see [Accessing SQLXML Functionality in the .NET Environment](../../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-xpath-queries/net-framework-classes/accessing-sqlxml-functionality-in-the-.net-environment.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can also write [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual Studio applications to bulk load XML documents by using XML Bulk Load. For more information, see [Performing Bulk Load of XML Data &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-xpath-queries/bulk-load-xml/performing-bulk-load-of-xml-data-sqlxml-4.0.md). You must add a reference to the XML Bulk Load DLL (Xblkld4.dll) in your application. This is a COM DLL for which Visual Studio .NET automatically creates the wrapper library.  
  
  This section provides sample applications that demonstrate how to use the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] SQLXML Managed Classes:
