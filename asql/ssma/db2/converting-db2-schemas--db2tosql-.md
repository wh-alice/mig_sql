# Converting DB2 Schemas (DB2ToSQL)
After you have connected to DB2, connected to SQL Server, and set project and data mapping options, you can convert DB2 database objects to SQL Server database objects.  
  
## The Conversion Process  
Converting database objects takes the object definitions from DB2, converts them to similar SQL Server objects, and then loads this information into the SSMA metadata. It does not load the information into the instance of SQL Server. You can then view the objects and their properties by using the SQL Server Metadata Explorer.  
  
During the conversion, SSMA prints output messages to the Output pane and error messages to the Error List pane. Use the output and error information to determine whether you have to modify your DB2 databases or your conversion process to obtain the desired conversion results.  
  
## Setting Conversion Options  
Before converting objects, review the project conversion options in the **Project Settings** dialog box. By using this dialog box, you can set how SSMA converts functions and global variables. For more information, see [Project Settings &#40;Conversion&#41; &#40;DB2ToSQL&#41;](../../ssma/db2/project-settings--conversion---db2tosql-.md).  
  
## Conversion Results  
The following table shows which DB2 objects are converted, and the resulting SQL Server objects:

## Converting DB2 Database Objects  
To convert DB2 database objects, you first select the objects that you want to convert, and then have SSMA perform the conversion. To view output messages during the conversion, on the **View** menu, select **Output**.  
  
**To convert DB2 objects to SQL Server syntax**  
  
1.  In DB2 Metadata Explorer, expand the DB2 server, and then expand **Schemas**.  
  
2.  Select objects to convert:  
  
    -   To convert all schemas, select the check box next to **Schemas**.  
  
    -   To convert or omit a database, select the check box next to the schema name.  
  
    -   To convert or omit a category of objects, expand a schema, and then select or clear the check box next to the category.  
  
    -   To convert or omit individual objects, expand the category folder, and then select or clear the check box next to the object.  
  
3.  To convert all selected objects, right-click **Schemas** and select **Convert Schema**.  
  
    You can also convert individual objects or categories of objects by right-clicking the object or its parent folder, and then selecting **Convert Schema**.  
  
## Viewing Conversion Problems  
Some DB2 objects might not be converted. You can determine the conversion success rates by viewing the summary conversion report.  
  
**To view a summary report**  
  
1.  In DB2 Metadata Explorer, select **Schemas**.  
  
2.  In the right pane, select the **Report** tab.  
  
    This report shows the summary assessment report for all database objects that have been assessed or converted. You can also view a summary report for individual objects:  
  
    -   To view the report for an individual schema, select the schema in DB2 Metadata Explorer.  
  
    -   To view the report for an individual object, select the object in DB2 Metadata Explorer. Objects that have conversion problems have a red error icon.  
  
For objects that failed conversion, you can view the syntax that resulted in the conversion failure.  
  
**To view individual conversion problems**  
  
1.  In DB2 Metadata Explorer, expand **Schemas**.  
  
2.  Expand the schema that shows a red error icon.  
  
3.  Under the schema, expand a folder that has a red error icon.  
  
4.  Select the object that has a red error icon.  
  
5.  In the right pane, click the **Report** tab.  
  
6.  At the top of the **Report** tab is a drop-down list. If the list shows **Statistics**, change the selection to **Source**.  
  
    SSMA will display the source code and several buttons immediately above the code.  
  
7.  Click the **Next Problem** button. This is a red error icon with an arrow that points to the right.  
  
    SSMA will highlight the first problematic source code it finds in the current object.  
  
For each item that could not be converted, you have to determine what you want to do with that object:  
  
-   You can modify the source code for procedures on the **SQL** tab.  
  
-   You can modify the object in the DB2 database to remove or revise problematic code. To load the updated code into SSMA, you will have to update the metadata. For more information, see [Connecting to DB2 Database &#40;DB2ToSQL&#41;](../../ssma/db2/connecting-to-db2-database--db2tosql-.md).  
  
-   You can exclude the object from migration. In SQL Server Metadata Explorer and DB2 Metadata Explorer, clear the check box next to the item before loading the objects into SQL Server and migrating data from DB2.  
  
## Next Step  
The next step in the migration process is to [Load the converted objects into SQL Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f4ea1ced-9f9f-4a9d-88ab-81dbab64adc3).
