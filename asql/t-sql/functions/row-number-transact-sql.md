# ROW_NUMBER (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Numbers the output of a result set. More specifically, returns the sequential number of a row within a partition of a result set, starting at 1 for the first row in each partition. 
  
`ROW_NUMBER` and `RANK` are similar. `ROW_NUMBER` numbers all rows sequentially (for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). `RANK` provides the same numeric value for ties (for example 1, 2, 2, 4, 5).   
  
> [!NOTE]
> `ROW_NUMBER` is a temporary value calculated when the query is run. To persist numbers in a table, see [IDENTITY Property](IDENTITY%20\(Property\)%20\(Transact-SQL\).md) and [SEQUENCE](../../t-sql/statements/create-sequence-transact-sql.md). 
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
 
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
ROW_NUMBER ( )   
    OVER ( [ PARTITION BY value_expression , ... [ n ] ] order_by_clause )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 PARTITION BY *value_expression*  
 Divides the result set produced by the [FROM](../../t-sql/queries/from-transact-sql.md) clause into partitions to which the ROW_NUMBER function is applied. *value_expression* specifies the column by which the result set is partitioned. If `PARTITION BY` is not specified, the function treats all rows of the query result set as a single group. For more information, see [OVER Clause &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../Topic/OVER%20Clause%20\(Transact-SQL\).md).  
  
 *order_by_clause*  
 The `ORDER BY` clause determines the sequence in which the rows are assigned their unique `ROW_NUMBER` within a specified partition. It is required. For more information, see [OVER Clause &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../Topic/OVER%20Clause%20\(Transact-SQL\).md).  
  
## Return Types  
 **bigint**  
  
## General Remarks  
 There is no guarantee that the rows returned by a query using `ROW_NUMBER()` will be ordered exactly the same with each execution unless the following conditions are true.  
  
1.  Values of the partitioned column are unique.  
  
2.  Values of the `ORDER BY` columns are unique.  
  
3.  Combinations of values of the partition column and `ORDER BY` columns are unique.  
  
 `ROW_NUMBER()` is nondeterministic. For more information, see [Deterministic and Nondeterministic Functions](../../relational-databases/user-defined-functions/deterministic-and-nondeterministic-functions.md).  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Simple examples 

The following query returns the four system tables in alphabetic order.

```
SELECT 
  name, recovery_model_desc
FROM sys.databases 
WHERE database_id < 5
ORDER BY name ASC;
```

 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
   
|name    |recovery_model_desc |  
|-----------  |------------ |  
|master |SIMPLE |
|model |FULL |
|msdb |SIMPLE |
|tempdb |SIMPLE |

To add a row number column in front of each row, add a column with the `ROW_NUMBER` function, in this case named `Row#`. You must move the `ORDER BY` clause up to the `OVER` clause.

```
SELECT 
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name ASC) AS Row#,
  name, recovery_model_desc
FROM sys.databases 
WHERE database_id < 5;
```

 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
   
|Row# |name    |recovery_model_desc |  
|------- |-----------  |------------ |  
|1 |master |SIMPLE |
|2 |model |FULL |
|3 |msdb |SIMPLE |
|4 |tempdb |SIMPLE |

Adding a `PARTITION BY` clause on the `recovery_model_desc` column, will restart the numbering when the `recovery_model_desc` value changes. 
 
```
SELECT 
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY recovery_model_desc ORDER BY name ASC) 
    AS Row#,
  name, recovery_model_desc
FROM sys.databases WHERE database_id < 5;
```  

 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
   
|Row# |name    |recovery_model_desc |  
|------- |-----------  |------------ |  
|1 |model |FULL |
|1 |master |SIMPLE |
|2 |msdb |SIMPLE |
|3 |tempdb |SIMPLE |


### B. Returning the row number for salespeople  
 The following example calculates a row number for the salespeople in [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoFull](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sssampledbcofull-md.md)] based on their year-to-date sales ranking.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;   
GO  
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY SalesYTD DESC) AS Row,   
    FirstName, LastName, ROUND(SalesYTD,2,1) AS "Sales YTD"   
FROM Sales.vSalesPerson  
WHERE TerritoryName IS NOT NULL AND SalesYTD <> 0;  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
```  
  
Row FirstName    LastName               SalesYTD  
--- -----------  ---------------------- -----------------  
1   Linda        Mitchell               4251368.54  
2   Jae          Pak                    4116871.22  
3   Michael      Blythe                 3763178.17  
4   Jillian      Carson                 3189418.36  
5   Ranjit       Varkey Chudukatil      3121616.32  
6   José         Saraiva                2604540.71  
7   Shu          Ito                    2458535.61  
8   Tsvi         Reiter                 2315185.61  
9   Rachel       Valdez                 1827066.71  
10  Tete         Mensa-Annan            1576562.19  
11  David        Campbell               1573012.93  
12  Garrett      Vargas                 1453719.46  
13  Lynn         Tsoflias               1421810.92  
14  Pamela       Ansman-Wolfe           1352577.13  
```  
  
### C. Returning a subset of rows  
 The following example calculates row numbers for all rows in the `SalesOrderHeader` table in the order of the `OrderDate` and returns only rows `50` to `60` inclusive.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
WITH OrderedOrders AS  
(  
    SELECT SalesOrderID, OrderDate,  
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY OrderDate) AS RowNumber  
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader   
)   
SELECT SalesOrderID, OrderDate, RowNumber    
FROM OrderedOrders   
WHERE RowNumber BETWEEN 50 AND 60;  
```  
  
### D. Using ROW_NUMBER() with PARTITION  
 The following example uses the `PARTITION BY` argument to partition the query result set by the column `TerritoryName`. The `ORDER BY` clause specified in the `OVER` clause orders the rows in each partition by the column `SalesYTD`. The `ORDER BY` clause in the `SELECT` statement orders the entire query result set by `TerritoryName`.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT FirstName, LastName, TerritoryName, ROUND(SalesYTD,2,1),  
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY TerritoryName ORDER BY SalesYTD DESC) 
  AS Row  
FROM Sales.vSalesPerson  
WHERE TerritoryName IS NOT NULL AND SalesYTD <> 0  
ORDER BY TerritoryName;  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
```  
  
FirstName  LastName             TerritoryName        SalesYTD      Row

Michael    Blythe               Northeast            3763178.17    1  
Tete       Mensa-Annan          Northwest            1576562.19    1  
David      Campbell             Northwest            1573012.93    2  
Pamela     Ansman-Wolfe         Northwest            1352577.13    3  
Tsvi       Reiter               Southeast            2315185.61    1  
Linda      Mitchell             Southwest            4251368.54    1  
Shu        Ito                  Southwest            2458535.61    2  
Jae        Pak                  United Kingdom       4116871.22    1  
```  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
  
### E. Returning the row number for salespeople  
 The following example returns the `ROW_NUMBER` for sales representatives based on their assigned sales quota.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(SalesAmountQuota) DESC) 
    AS RowNumber,  
    FirstName, LastName,   
    CONVERT(varchar(13), SUM(SalesAmountQuota),1) AS SalesQuota   
FROM dbo.DimEmployee AS e  
INNER JOIN dbo.FactSalesQuota AS sq  
    ON e.EmployeeKey = sq.EmployeeKey  
WHERE e.SalesPersonFlag = 1  
GROUP BY LastName, FirstName;  
```  
  
 Here is a partial result set.  
  
 `RowNumber  FirstName  LastName            SalesQuota`  
  
 `---------  ---------  ------------------  -------------`  
  
 `1          Jillian    Carson              12,198,000.00`  
  
 `2          Linda      Mitchell            11,786,000.00`  
  
 `3          Michael    Blythe              11,162,000.00`  
  
 `4          Jae        Pak                 10,514,000.00`  
  
### F. Using ROW_NUMBER() with PARTITION  
 The following example shows using the `ROW_NUMBER` function with the `PARTITION BY` argument. This causes the `ROW_NUMBER` function to number the rows in each partition.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY SalesTerritoryKey 
        ORDER BY SUM(SalesAmountQuota) DESC) AS RowNumber,  
    LastName, SalesTerritoryKey AS Territory,  
    CONVERT(varchar(13), SUM(SalesAmountQuota),1) AS SalesQuota   
FROM dbo.DimEmployee AS e  
INNER JOIN dbo.FactSalesQuota AS sq  
    ON e.EmployeeKey = sq.EmployeeKey  
WHERE e.SalesPersonFlag = 1  
GROUP BY LastName, FirstName, SalesTerritoryKey;  
```  
  
 Here is a partial result set.  
  
 `RowNumber  LastName            Territory  SalesQuota`  
  
 `---------  ------------------  ---------  -------------`  
  
 `1          Campbell            1           4,025,000.00`  
  
 `2          Ansman-Wolfe        1           3,551,000.00`  
  
 `3          Mensa-Annan         1           2,275,000.00`  
  
 `1          Blythe              2          11,162,000.00`  
  
 `1          Carson              3          12,198,000.00`  
  
 `1          Mitchell            4          11,786,000.00`  
  
 `2          Ito                 4           7,804,000.00`
