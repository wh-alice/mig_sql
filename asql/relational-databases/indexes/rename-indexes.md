# Rename Indexes
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/data-compression/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This topic describes how to rename an index in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)]. Renaming an index replaces the current index name with the new name that you provide. The specified name must be unique within the table or view. For example, two tables can have an index named **XPK_1**, but the same table cannot have two indexes named **XPK_1**. You cannot create an index with the same name as an existing disabled index. Renaming an index does not cause the index to be rebuilt.

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
 When you create a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint on a table, an index with the same name as the constraint is automatically created for the table. Because index names must be unique within the table, you cannot create or rename an index to have the same name as an existing PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint on the table.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Requires ALTER permission on the index.

    --Renames the IX_ProductVendor_VendorID index on the Purchasing.ProductVendor table to IX_VendorID.   
  
    EXEC sp_rename N'Purchasing.ProductVendor.IX_ProductVendor_VendorID', N'IX_VendorID', N'INDEX';   
    GO  
    ```
