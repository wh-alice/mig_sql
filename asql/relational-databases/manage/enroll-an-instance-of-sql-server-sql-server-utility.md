# Enroll an Instance of SQL Server (SQL Server Utility)
  Enroll an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] into an existing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility to monitor its performance and configuration as a managed instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The utility control point (UCP) collects configuration and performance information from managed instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] every 15 minutes. This information is stored in the utility management data warehouse (UMDW) on the UCP; the UMDW file name is sysutility_mdw. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] performance data is compared to policies to help identify resource use bottlenecks and consolidation opportunities.  
  
 In this release, the UCP and all managed instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] must satisfy the following requirements:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] must be version 10.50 or higher.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance type must be [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility must operate within a single Windows domain, or domains with two-way trust relationships.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service accounts on the UCP and all managed instances of SQL Server must have read permission to Users in Active Directory.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance to enroll cannot be SQL Azure.  
  
 In this release, the UCP must satisfy the following requirements:  
  
-   The instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] must be a supported edition. For a list of features that are supported by the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2016](../Topic/Features%20Supported%20by%20the%20Editions%20of%20SQL%20Server%202016.md).  
  
-   We recommend that the UCP is hosted by a case-sensitive instance of SQL Server.  
  
-   Consider the following recommendations for capacity planning on the UCP computer:  
  
    -   In a typical scenario, disk space used by the UMDW database (sysutility_mdw) on the UCP is approximately 2 GB per managed instance of SQL Server per year. This estimate can vary depending on the number of database and system objects collected by the managed instance. The UMDW (sysutility_mdw) disk space growth rate is highest during the first two days.  
  
    -   In a typical scenario, disk space used by msdb on the UCP is approximately 20 MB per managed instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Note that this estimate can vary depending on the resource utilization policies and the number of database and system objects collected by the managed instance. In general, disk space usage increases as the number of policy violations increases and the duration of the moving time window for volatile resources increases.  
  
    -   Note that removing a managed instance from the UCP will not reduce the disk space used by UCP databases until expiration of data retention periods for the managed instance.  
  
 In this release, all managed instances of SQL Server must satisfy the following requirements:  
  
-   We recommend that if the UCP is hosted by a case-insensitive instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], then managed instances of SQL Server should also be case-insensitive.  
  
-   FILESTREAM data are not supported for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility monitoring.  
  
 For more information, see [Maximum Capacity Specifications for SQL Server](../../sql-server/maximum-capacity-specifications-for-sql-server.md) and [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2016](../Topic/Features%20Supported%20by%20the%20Editions%20of%20SQL%20Server%202016.md).  
  
 For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility concepts, see [SQL Server Utility Features and Tasks](../../relational-databases/manage/sql-server-utility-features-and-tasks.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility collection set is supported side-by-side with non- [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility collection sets. That is, a managed instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can be monitored by other collection sets while it is a member of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility. Note, however, that all collection sets on the managed instance upload their data to the utility management data warehouse. For more information, see [Considerations for Running Utility and non-Utility Collection Sets on the Same Instance of SQL Server](../../relational-databases/manage/ca7ee9b3-ef9a-4ba4-83d0-9ee9f80dab27.md) and [Configure Your Utility Control Point Data Warehouse &#40;SQL Server Utility&#41;](../../relational-databases/manage/configure-your-utility-control-point-data-warehouse-sql-server-utility.md).
