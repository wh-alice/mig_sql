#### To Prepare a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Failover Cluster (Unattended)  
  
1.  Prepare the image (as discussed in [Considerations for Installing SQL Server Using SysPrep](../../../database-engine/install/windows/considerations-for-installing-sql-server-using-sysprep.md)) and capture the windows image through SysPrep Generalization. The following sample prepares the image:  
  
    ```  
    Setup.exe /q /ACTION=PrepareImage l /FEATURES=SQLEngine /InstanceID =<MYINST> /IACCEPTSQLSERVERLICENSETERMS  
    ```  
  
     Then run Windows SysPrep Generalization.  
  
2.  Deploy the image by running Windows SysPrep Specialize.  
  
3.  Create the Windows Failover Cluster.  
  
4.  Run setup.exe with **/ACTION=PrepareFailoverCluster** all nodes. For example:  
  
    ```  
    setup.exe /q /ACTION=PrepareFailoverCluster /InstanceName=<InstanceName> /Features=SQLEngine  /SQLSVCACCOUNT="<DomainName\UserName>" /SQLSVCPASSWORD="xxxxxxxxxxx"  /IACCEPTSQLSERVERLICENSETERMS  
    ```  
  
#### Complete a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Failover Cluster (Unattended)  
  
1.  Run setup.exe with **/ACTION=CompleteFailoverCluster** on the node that owns the available storage group:  
  
    ```  
    setup.exe /q /ACTION=CompleteFailoverCluster /InstanceName=<InstanceName>  /FAILOVERCLUSTERDISKS="<Cluster Disk Resource Name - for example, 'Disk S:'>:" /FAILOVERCLUSTERNETWORKNAME="<Insert FOI Network Name>" /FAILOVERCLUSTERIPADDRESSES="IPv4;xx.xxx.xx.xx;Cluster Network;xxx.xxx.xxx.x" /FAILOVERCLUSTERGROUP="MSSQLSERVER" /INSTALLSQLDATADIR="<Drive>:\<Path>\MSSQLSERVER" /SQLCOLLATION="SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS" /SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS="<DomainName\UserName>"  
    ```  
  
#### Adding a Node to an Existing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Failover Cluster (Unattended)  
  
1.  Deploy the image by running Windows SysPrep Specialize.  
  
2.  Join the Windows Failover Cluster.  
  
3.  Run setup.exe with **/ACTION=AddNode** on all nodes:  
  
    ```  
    setup.exe /q /ACTION=AddNode /InstanceName=<InstanceName> /Features=SQLEngine  /SQLSVCACCOUNT="<DomainName\UserName>" /SQLSVCPASSWORD="xxxxxxxxxxx"  /IACCEPTSQLSERVERLICENSETERMS  
    ```  
  
##  <a name="prepare"></a> Prepare Image  
  
#### Prepare a stand-alone instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
1.  Insert the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation media. From the root folder, double-click Setup.exe. To install from a network share, locate the root folder on the share, and then double-click Setup.exe.  
  
2.  The Installation Wizard runs the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Center. To prepare an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], click **Image preparation of a stand-alone instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]** on the **Advanced** page.  
  
3.  The System Configuration Checker runs a discovery operation on your computer. To continue, click **OK**. You can view the details on the screen by clicking **Show Details**, or as an HTML report by clicking **View detailed report**.  
  
4.  On the Product Updates page, the latest available [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] product updates are displayed. If you don't want to include the updates, clear the **Include [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] product updates** check box. If no product updates are discovered, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup does not display this page and auto advances to the **Install Setup Files** page.  
  
5.  On the Install Setup files page, Setup provides the progress of downloading, extracting, and installing the Setup files. If an update for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup is found, and is specified to be included, that update will also be installed.  
  
6.  The System Configuration Checker verifies the system state of your computer before Setup continues. You can view the details on the screen by clicking **Show Details**, or as an HTML report by clicking **View detailed report**.  
  
7.  On the **Prepare Image Type** page, select **Prepare a new instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]**.  
  
     The **Prepare Image Type** page is displayed only when you have an existing un-configured prepared instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on the machine. You can choose to prepare a new instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or add sys prep supported features to an existing prepared instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on the machine. For more information on how to add features to a prepared instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] see [Add Features to a prepared instance](#AddFeatures).  
  
8.  On the **License Terms** page, read the license agreement, and then select the check box to accept the license terms and conditions. To help improve [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can also enable the feature usage option and send reports to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)].  
  
9. On the **Feature Selection** page, select the components for your installation:  
  
    |||  
    |-|-|  
    |[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] SysPrep|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)]<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Replication<br /><br /> Full-Text Features<br /><br /> Data Quality Services<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] in Native mode<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]<br /><br /> Redistributable Features<br /><br /> Shared Features|  
  
     A description for each component group appears in the right pane when you highlight the feature name. You can select any combination of check boxes. For more information, see [Editions and Components of SQL Server 2016](../../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2016.md) and [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2016](../Topic/Features%20Supported%20by%20the%20Editions%20of%20SQL%20Server%202016.md).  
  
     The prerequisites for the selected features are displayed on the right-hand pane. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup will install the prerequisite that are not already installed during the installation step described later in this procedure.  
  
10. On the **Prepare Image Rules** page, the System Configuration Checker verifies the system state of your computer before Setup continues. You can view the details on the screen by clicking **Show Details**, or as an HTML report by clicking **View detailed report**.  
  
11. On the Instance Configuration page, specify the Instance ID for the Instance. Click **Next** to continue.  
  
     **Instance ID** — The Instance ID is used to identify installation directories and registry keys for your instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This is the case for default instances and named instances. If the prepared instance is completed as a default Instance during the Complete step, the instance name is overwritten as MSSQLSERVER. The Instance ID remains the same as specified.  
  
     **Instance root directory** — By default, the instance root directory is [!INCLUDE[ssInstallPath](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/ssinstallpath-md.md)]. To specify a non-default root directory, use the field provided, or click **Browse** to locate an installation folder. The directory specified in the prepare step will be used during configuration in the Complete step.  
  
     All [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service packs and upgrades will apply to every component of an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
     **Installed Instances** — The grid shows instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that are on the computer where Setup is running.  
  
12. The **Disk Space Requirements** page calculates the required disk space for the features that you specify. Then it compares the required space to the available disk space.  
  
13. The System Configuration Checker will run prepare image rules to validate your computer configuration with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features that you have specified. You can view the details on the screen by clicking **Show Details**, or as an HTML report by clicking **View detailed report**.  
  
14. The **Ready to Prepare Image** page shows a tree view of installation options that were specified during Setup. On this page, Setup indicates whether the Product Update feature is enabled or disabled and the final update version. To continue, click **Prepare**. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup will first install the required prerequisites for the selected features followed by the feature installation.  
  
15. During installation, the **Prepare Image Progress** page provides status so that you can monitor installation progress as Setup continues.  
  
16. After installation, the **Complete** page provides a link to the summary log file for the installation and other important notes. To complete the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation process, click **Close**.  
  
17. If you are instructed to restart the computer, do so now. It is important to read the message from the Installation Wizard when you have finished with Setup. For more information, see [View and Read SQL Server Setup Log Files](../../../database-engine/install/windows/view-and-read-sql-server-setup-log-files.md).  
  
18. This completes the prepare step. You may complete the image or deploy the prepared image as described in [Considerations for Installing SQL Server Using SysPrep](../../../database-engine/install/windows/considerations-for-installing-sql-server-using-sysprep.md).

If you wish to add more features to your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Instance not included in the prepared instance, you must first complete this step to complete the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Instance, then add the features from the **Add Features** on the **Installation Center**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can add features that are available for the product version that you are installing. For more information, see [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2016](../Topic/Features%20Supported%20by%20the%20Editions%20of%20SQL%20Server%202016.md)  
  
9. On the Instance Configuration page, specify the Instance name for the prepared Instance. This is the name of the instance once you have completed the configuration of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Click **Next** to continue.  
  
     **Instance ID** — The Instance ID is used to identify installation directories and registry keys for your instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This is the case for default instances and named instances. If the prepared instance is completed as a default Instance during the Complete step, the instance name is overwritten as MSSQLSERVER. The Instance ID remains the same as specified during the Prepare step.  
  
     **Instance root directory** —The directory specified in the prepare step will be used and cannot be modified in this step.  
  
     All [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service packs and upgrades will apply to every component of an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
     **Installed instances** — The grid shows instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that are on the computer where Setup is running.  
  
10. Work flow for the rest of this topic depends on the features that were selected during the prepare step. You might not see all the pages, depending on the selections.  
  
11. On the **Server Configuration** — Service Accounts page, specify login accounts for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services. The actual services that are configured on this page depend on the features that you selected to install.  
  
     You can assign the same login account to all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services, or you can configure each service account individually. You can also specify whether services start automatically, are started manually, or are disabled. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] recommends that you configure service accounts individually to provide least privileges for each service, where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services are granted the minimum permissions they have to have to complete their tasks. For more information, see [Server Configuration - Service Accounts](../Topic/Server%20Configuration%20-%20Service%20Accounts.md) and [Configure Windows Service Accounts and Permissions](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/configure-windows-service-accounts-and-permissions.md).
