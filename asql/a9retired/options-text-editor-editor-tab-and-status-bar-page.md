# Options (Text Editor: Editor Tab and Status Bar Page)
  The **Editor Tab and Status Bar Page** lets you customize the information displayed by the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Query Editors. You can specify the level of information displayed in the tab and status bar of the Query Editor window, and whether the status bar appears at the top or bottom of the editor window.  
  
## Option Settings by Editor  
 The editor tab and the status bar are available in all of the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] editors, but have different levels of functionality.  
  
 The Database Engine Query Editor can connect to a server group, in which case it opens connections to all the instances in the Server Group and can simultaneously run the same query on each connection. You can use this dialog to specify that the status bar has different colors when connected to multiple instances rather than one instance.To change the multi-server results options, use the [Options (Query Results/SQL Server/Multi-Server)](../a9retired/options-query-results-sql-server-multi-server.md) page.  
  
## Status Bar Content

 **Display execution time**  
 Includes the script execution time. The settings are as follows:  
  
 **None**

 **End**  
 The status bar displays the current time of day while the script is running. When the script completes, the display shows the time of day that the script completed.  
  
 **Elapsed**  
 The status bar displays the length of time that the script has been running. When the script completes, the display shows how much time was taken to run the script.  
  
 **Include database name**
