# SQL Server Native Client ODBC Data Sources
[!INCLUDE[SNAC_Deprecated](../../a9retired/includes/snac-deprecated.md)]

  A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data source name (DSN) identifies an ODBC data source containing all of the information that an ODBC application needs to connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database on a specific server. There are two ways you can define an ODBC data source name:  
  
-   On a client computer, open Administrative Tools in Control Panel, and double-click **Data Sources (ODBC)**. This will open the ODBC Data Source Administrator, which you can use to create a DSN.  
  
-   In an ODBC application, call [SQLConfigDataSource](../../relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-reference/sqlconfigdatasource.md).  
  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data source contains:  
  
-   The name of the data source.  
  
-   Any information needed to connect to a specific instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   The default database to use on a specific instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (optional).  
  
-   Settings such as which ANSI options to use, whether to log performance statistics, and so on (optional).  
  
 An ODBC application is not required to connect through a data source. However, the application must provide the same connectivity information to an ODBC connect function that the driver would otherwise find in a DSN.
