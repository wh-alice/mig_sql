# sys.spatial_index_tessellations (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

 Represents the information about the tessellation scheme and parameters of each of the spatial indexes.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For information about tessellation, see [Spatial Indexes Overview](../../../relational-databases/spatial/spatial-indexes-overview.md).  
  

|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|object_id|**int**|ID of the object on which the index is defined. Each (object_id, index_id) pair has a corresponding entry in [sys.spatial_indexes](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sys.spatial-indexes-transact-sql.md).|  
|index_id|**int**|ID of the spatial index in which the indexed column is defined|  
|tessellation_scheme|**sysname**|Name of the tessellation scheme, one of: GEOMETRY_GRID,  GEOGRAPHY_GRID|  
|bounding_box_xmin|**float(53)**|X-coordinate of the lower-left corner of the bounding box, one of: NULL = Not applicable for a given tessellation scheme (such as GEOGRAPHY_GRID) *n* = If tessellation_scheme is GEOMETRY_GRID, the x-min coordinate value.                     **Note:** The coordinates defined by the bounding box parameters are interpreted for each object according to its [Spatial Reference Identifier (SRID)](../../../relational-databases/spatial/spatial-reference-identifiers-srids.md).|  
|bounding_box_ymin|**float(53)**|Y-coordinate of the lower-left corner of the bounding box, one of: NULL = Not applicable for a given tessellation scheme (such as GEOGRAPHY_GRID) *n* = If tessellation_scheme is GEOMETRY_GRID, the y-min coordinate value|  
|bounding_box_xmax|**float(53)**|X-coordinate of the upper-right corner of the bounding box, one of: NULL = Not applicable for a given tessellation scheme (such as GEOGRAPHY_GRID) *n* = If tessellation_scheme is GEOMETRY_GRID, the x-max coordinate value|  
|bounding_box_ymax|**float(53)**|Y-coordinate of upper-right corner of the bounding box, one of: NULL = Not applicable for a given tessellation scheme (such as GEOGRAPHY_GRID) *n* = If tessellation_scheme is GEOMETRY_GRID, the y-max coordinate value|  
|level_1_grid|**smallint**|Grid density for the top-level grid. If tessellation_scheme is GEOMETRY_GRID or GEOGRAPHY_GRID, one of:          16 = 4 by 4 grid (LOW) 64 = 8 by 8 grid (MEDIUM) 256 = 16 by 16 grid (HIGH) NULL = Not applicable for given spatial index type or tessellation scheme.  NULL is returned when new SQL Server 11 tessellation is used.|  
|level_1_grid_desc|**nvarchar(60)**|Grid density for the top-level grid, one of: LOW MEDIUM HIGH NULL = Not applicable for given spatial index type or tessellation scheme.  NULL is returned when new SQL Server 11 tessellation is used.|  
|level_2_grid|**smallint**|Grid density for the 2nd-level grid. If tessellation_scheme is GEOMETRY_GRID or GEOGRAPHY_GRID, one of: 16 = 4 by 4 grid (LOW) 64 = 8 by 8 grid (MEDIUM) 256 = 16 by 16 grid (HIGH) NULL = Not applicable for given spatial index type or tessellation scheme.  NULL is returned when new SQL Server 11 tessellation is used.|  
|level_2_grid_desc|**nvarchar(60)**|Grid density for the 2nd-level grid, one of: LOW MEDIUM HIGH NULL = Not applicable for given spatial index type or tessellation scheme.  NULL is returned when new SQL Server 11 tessellation is used.|  
|level_3_grid|**smallint**|Grid density for the 3rd-level grid.   If tessellation_scheme is GEOMETRY_GRID or GEOGRAPHY_GRID, one of: 16 = 4 by 4 grid (LOW) 64 = 8 by 8 grid (MEDIUM) 256 = 16 by 16 grid (HIGH) NULL = Not applicable for given spatial index type or tessellation scheme.  NULL is returned when new SQL Server 11 tessellation is used.|  
|level_3_grid_desc|**nvarchar(60)**|Grid density for the 3rd-level grid, one of:LOW MEDIUM HIGH NULL = Not applicable for given spatial index type or tessellation scheme.  NULL is returned when new SQL Server 11 tessellation is used.|  
|level_4_grid|**smallint**|Grid density for the 4th-level grid. If tessellation_scheme is GEOMETRY_GRID or GEOGRAPHY_GRID, one of: 16 = 4 by 4 grid (LOW)64 = 8 by 8 grid (MEDIUM) 256 = 16 by 16 grid (HIGH) NULL = Not applicable for given spatial index type or tessellation scheme.  NULL is returned when new SQL Server 11 tessellation is used.|  
|level_4_grid_desc|**nvarchar(60)**|Grid density for the 4th-level grid, one of:< LOW MEDIUM HIGH NULL = Not applicable for given spatial index type or tessellation scheme.  NULL is returned when new SQL Server 11 tessellation is used.|  
|cells_per_object|**int**|Number of cells per spatial object, one of: If tessellation_scheme is GEOMETRY_GRID or GEOGRAPHY_GRID, *n* = number of cells per object NULL = Not applicable for given  spatial index type or tessellation scheme|
