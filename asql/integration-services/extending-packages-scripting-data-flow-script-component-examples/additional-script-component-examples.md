# Additional Script Component Examples
  The Script component is a configurable tool that you can use in the data flow of a package to fill almost any requirement that is not met by the sources, transformations, and destinations that are included with [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]. This section contains Script component code samples that demonstrate the various types of functionality that are available.  
  
 For samples that demonstrate how to configure the Script component as a basic source, transformation, or destination, see [Developing Specific Types of Script Components](../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting-data-flow-script-component-types/developing-specific-types-of-script-components.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to create components that you can more easily reuse across multiple Data Flow tasks and multiple packages, consider using the code in these Script component samples as the starting point for custom data flow components. For more information, see [Developing a Custom Data Flow Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/developing-a-custom-data-flow-component.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Simulating an Error Output for the Script Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting-data-flow-script-component-examples/simulating-an-error-output-for-the-script-component.md)  
 The Script component does not support a standard error output, but you can simulate a standard error output with very little additional configuration and coding.  
  
 [Enhancing an Error Output with the Script Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting-data-flow-script-component-examples/enhancing-an-error-output-with-the-script-component.md)  
 Explains and demonstrates how to add additional information to a standard error output by using the Script component.  
  
 [Creating an ODBC Destination with the Script Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting-data-flow-script-component-examples/creating-an-odbc-destination-with-the-script-component.md)  
 Explains and demonstrates how to create an ODBC data flow destination by using the Script component.  
  
 [Parsing Non-Standard Text File Formats with the Script Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting-data-flow-script-component-examples/parsing-non-standard-text-file-formats-with-the-script-component.md)  
 Explains and demonstrates how to parse two different non-standard text file formats into destination tables.
