# Work with CDC Services
  You can use the CDC Service Configuration Console to create a new CDC service and to prepare a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database for CDC.  
  
## Options  
 **Prepare SQL Server**  
 Select this option from the **Actions** pane on the right side of the CDC Service Configuration Console.  
  
 You can also right-click **Local CDC Services** and select **Prepare SQL Server**.  
  
 The Preparing SQL Server Instance for Oracle CDC dialog box opens.  
  
 For information on how to use this dialog box, see [Prepare SQL Server for CDC](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/prepare-sql-server-for-cdc.md). For information on how to enable a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance for CDC, see [How to Prepare SQL Server for CDC](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/how-to-prepare-sql-server-for-cdc.md).
