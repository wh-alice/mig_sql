# PredictNodeId (DMX)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns the Node_ID of the node to which the case is classified.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
PredictNodeId(<scalar column reference>)  
```  
  
## Applies To  
 A scalar column.  
  
## Return Type  
 \<scalar expression>  
  
## Examples  
 The following example returns whether the specified individual is likely to buy a bicycle, and also returns the nodeID of the node that they are most likely to be part of.  
  
```  
SELECT  
  [Bike Buyer],  
  PredictNodeId([Bike Buyer])  
From  
  [TM Decision Tree]  
NATURAL PREDICTION JOIN  
(SELECT 28 AS [Age],  
  '2-5 Miles' AS [Commute Distance],  
  'Graduate Degree' AS [Education],  
  0 AS [Number Cars Owned],  
  0 AS [Number Children At Home]) AS t  
```  
  
 You could then use the following statement to determine what is contained within the node:  
  
```  
SELECT   
  NODE_CAPTION   
FROM   
  [TM Decision Tree].CONTENT  
WHERE NODE_UNIQUE_NAME= '00000000100'   
```
