# Upload a File or Report (Report Manager)
  Report Manager provides an upload feature so that you can add reports, models, and other files to a report server without having to publish those items from a client application. Files that you upload from the file system are stored as items on the report server. The type of file you upload determines how it is stored:  
  
-   .rdl files are stored as reports.  
  
-   .smdl files are stored as report models.  
  
-   All other files, including shared data source (.rds) files, are uploaded as resources. Resources are not processed by a report server, but can be viewed in Report Manager if the report server supports the MIME type of the file.  
  
### To upload a file or report  
  
1.  Start [Report Manager  &#40;SSRS Native Mode&#41;](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/80949f9d-58f5-48e3-9342-9e9bf4e57896).  
  
2.  In Report Manager, navigate to the **Contents** page. Navigate to the folder to which you want to add an item.  
  
3.  Click **Upload File**.  
  
4.  Click **Browse** to select a file to upload. You can upload a report definition file, an image, a document, or any file that you want to make available on the report server.  
  
5.  Type a name for the new item. An item name can include spaces, but cannot include the reserved characters: ; ? : @ & = + , $ / * \< > |.  
  
6.  If you want to replace an existing item with the new item, select **Overwrite item if it exists**.
