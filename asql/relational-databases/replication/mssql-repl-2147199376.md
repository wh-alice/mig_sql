|Message Text|One or more articles in the publication are configured to have non-overlapping partitions that are unique for each subscription, and there is already another subscription with the same partition. Drop any unused subscription registrations for this partition or change the partitioning options for the article.|  
  
## Explanation  
 When a publication contains one or more articles that were configured by using *partition_options*=3, the merge process checks to make sure that there is only one subscription per partition.  
  
## User Action  
 If the publication contains stale subscriptions, drop these subscriptions by using **sp_dropmergesubscription**.
