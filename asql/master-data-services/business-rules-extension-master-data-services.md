# Business Rules Extension (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], you can apply user-defined SQL scripts as an extension of  pre-defined conditions and actions.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  All scripts  have to be defined under  [usr] schema.  
  
 SQL functions that meet the following criteria can be used as a Business Rule condition.  
  
-   The return value type must be BIT.  
  
-   Only following types are supported for parameter types.  
  
    -   NVARCHAR  
  
    -   DATETIME2  
  
    -   DECIMAL (precision, scale)  
  
         precision must be 38  
  
         scale must be a value from 0 through 7  
  
 SQL stored procedures that use the following syntax can be used as a Business Rule action  
  
```  
CREATE PROCEDURE [usr].[YourAction]  
       (         
            @MemberIdList mdm.[MemberId] READONLY,  
            @ModelName NVARCHAR(MAX),  
            @VersionName NVARCHAR(MAX),  
            @EntityName NVARCHAR(MAX),  
            @BusinessRuleName NVARCHAR(MAX)  
        )    
      AS BEGIN    
       ...     
       END  
  
```  
  
 User-defined scripts will not be added to deployment packages. Make sure the target Master Data Services database contains all scripts that are used in the business rules before deploying a package.  
  
 Script actions will be executed as mds_br_user which has following permissions  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|**Schema**|**Permissions**|  
|mdm|SELECT|  
|stg|SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE, INSERT|  
|usr|FULL|

-   User defined scripts had been added to the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database.
