# Lesson 1-2 - Connect with Registered Servers and Object Explorer
This tutorial demonstrates the use of Registered Servers and Object Explorer.  
  
This tutorial uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../../a9retired/includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database. To help enhance security, by default, the sample databases are not installed. For more information, see [Installing SQL Server Samples and Sample Databases](http://sqlserversamples.codeplex.com).  
  
## Connecting to Servers  
The toolbar of the Registered Servers component has buttons for the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]. You can register one or more of these server types for convenient management. Try the following exercise to register the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../../a9retired/includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
#### To register the database  
  
1.  On the Registered Servers toolbar, click **Database Engine** if you have to. (It may already be selected.)  
  
2.  Expand **Database Engine**.  
  
3.  Right-click **Local Server Groups**, and then click **New Server Registration**.  
  
4.  In the **New Server Registration** dialog box, in the **Server name** text box, type the name of your instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
5.  In the **Registered server name** box, type [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../../a9retired/includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)].  
  
6.  On the **Connection Properties** tab, in the **Connect to database** list, select **\<Browse serverâ€¦>**.  
  
7.  In the **Browse for Databases** dialog box, click **Yes**.  
  
8.  In the **Browse Server for Database** dialog box, select [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../../a9retired/includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)], and then click **OK**.  
  
9. To verify that the server has been registered correctly, click **Test**.  
  
10. In the **New Server Registration** dialog box, click **Save**.  
  
## Connecting with Object Explorer  
Like Registered Servers, Object Explorer can connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
#### To connect with Object Explorer  
  
1.  On the toolbar of Object Explorer, click **Connect** for a list of possible connection types, and then select **Database Engine**.  
  
2.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, in the **Server name** text box, type the name of your instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
3.  Click **Options** and explore the choices.  
  
4.  To connect to the server, click **Connect**. If you are already connected, this action just returns you to Object Explorer and sets the focus on that server.  
  
    With Object Explorer you can administer [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Security, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent, Replication, and Database Mail. Object Explorer can only manage some of the features of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)]. Each of those components has additional specialized tools.  
  
5.  In Object Explorer, expand the **Databases** folder and select [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../../a9retired/includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)].  
  
    Notice that [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] presents the system databases in a separate folder.
