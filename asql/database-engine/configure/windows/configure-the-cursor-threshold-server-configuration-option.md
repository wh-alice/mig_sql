# Configure the cursor threshold Server Configuration Option
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This topic describes how to configure the **cursor threshold** server configuration option in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)]. The **cursor threshold** option specifies the number of rows in the cursor set at which cursor keysets are generated asynchronously. When cursors generate a keyset for a result set, the query optimizer estimates the number of rows that will be returned for that result set. If the query optimizer estimates that the number of returned rows is greater than this threshold, the cursor is generated asynchronously, allowing the user to fetch rows from the cursor while the cursor continues to be populated. Otherwise, the cursor is generated synchronously, and the query waits until all rows are returned.

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not support generating keyset-driven or static [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] cursors asynchronously. [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] cursor operations such as OPEN or FETCH are batched, so there is no need for the asynchronous generation of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] cursors. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] continues to support asynchronous keyset-driven or static application programming interface (API) server cursors where low latency OPEN is a concern, due to client round trips for each cursor operation.  
  
-   The accuracy of the query optimizer to determine an estimate for the number of rows in a keyset depends on the currency of the statistics for each of the tables in the cursor.  
  
###  <a name="Recommendations"></a> Recommendations  
  
-   This option is an advanced option and should be changed only by an experienced database administrator or certified [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] technician.  
  
-   If you set **cursor threshold** to -1, all keysets are generated synchronously, which benefits small cursor sets. If you set **cursor threshold** to 0, all cursor keysets are generated asynchronously. With other values, the query optimizer compares the number of expected rows in the cursor set and builds the keyset asynchronously if it exceeds the number set in **cursor threshold**. Do not set **cursor threshold** too low, because small result sets are better built synchronously.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Execute permissions on **sp_configure** with no parameters or with only the first parameter are granted to all users by default. To execute **sp_configure** with both parameters to change a configuration option or to run the RECONFIGURE statement, a user must be granted the ALTER SETTINGS server-level permission. The ALTER SETTINGS permission is implicitly held by the **sysadmin** and **serveradmin** fixed server roles.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To configure the cursor threshold option  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, right-click a server and select **Properties**.  
  
2.  Click the **Advanced** node.  
  
3.  Under **Miscellaneous**, change the **Cursor Threshold** option to the value you want.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To configure the cursor threshold option  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**. This example shows how to use [sp_configure](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md) to set the `cursor threshold` option to `0` so that cursor keysets are generated asynchronously.  
  
```tsql  
USE AdventureWorks2012 ;  
GO  
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1 ;  
GO  
RECONFIGURE  
GO  
EXEC sp_configure 'cursor threshold', 0 ;  
GO  
RECONFIGURE  
GO  
  
```  
  
 For more information, see [Server Configuration Options &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/server-configuration-options-sql-server.md).  
  
##  <a name="FollowUp"></a> Follow Up: After you configure the cursor threshold option  
 The setting takes effect immediately without restarting the server.
