|Message Text|The Merge Agent failed after detecting that retention-based metadata cleanup has deleted metadata at the Publisher for changes not yet sent to the Subscriber. You must reinitialize the subscription (without upload).|  
  
## Explanation  
 The merge process failed because it detected that retention-based metadata cleanup at the Subscriber has deleted metadata for changes that have not been sent to the Publisher.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  Error -2147199402 may also be caused by other problems with the metadata, such as configuring the publication for aggressive cleanup or subscriber syncing outside of the retention period.  
  
## User Action  
 Reinitialize the subscription by using **@upload_first = 'FALSE'**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The last sync date can be found in the sysmergesubscriptions table.
