# Setup or Configure R Tools
  Microsoft R Server provides all the base R libraries, the a set of ScaleR packages, and standard R tools that you need to develop and test R code. However, if you want to use a dedicated R development environment, there are several available, including many free tools.  
  
## Basic R Tools  
 Additional tools are not required in an installation of Microsoft R Server, because all the standard R tools that are included in a *base installation* of R are installed by default.

-   **RTerm**: A command-line tool for running R scripts 
  
-   **RGui.exe**:  A simple interactive editor for R. The command-line arguments are the same for RGui.exe and RTerm. 
  
-   **RScript**: A command-line tool for running R scripts in batch mode.  

To locate these tools, find the R library location. This varies depending on whether you installed only SQL Server R Services, or if you also installed R Server (Standalone). For more information, see [What is Installed and Where to Find R Packages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt695941(sql.130).aspx#Anchor_1)

Then, look in the folder `..\R_SERVER\bin\x64`.  

> [!TIP]  
>  Need help with the R tools? Documentation is included, in the setup folder: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\R_SERVER\doc` and in `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\R_SERVER\doc\manual`.  
>   
>  Or, just open **RGui**, click **Help**, and select one of the options.  

## Microsoft R Client

Microsoft R Client is a free download that lets you develop R solutions that can be easily run in Microsoft R Server or in SQL Server R Services. This option is provided to help data scientists who might not have access to R Server (available in Enterprise Edition) develop solutions that use ScaleR. 

If you use a different R development environment, such as R Tools for Visual Studio or RStudio, to use ScaleR you must specify that the Microsoft R Client be used as the R executable. This gives you full access to the RevoScaleR package and other features of Microsoft R Server, although performance will be limited.

You can also use the tools provided in R Client, such as RGui and RTerm, to run scripts or write and execute ad hoc R code.

[Install Microsoft R Client](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/r-client-install)
  
##  <a name="bkmk_RTools"></a> R Tools for Visual Studio  

 For convenience in working with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases, consider using [!INCLUDE[rsql_rtvs](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-rtvs-md.md)] as your development environment. [!INCLUDE[rsql_rtvs](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-rtvs-md.md)] is a free add-in for Visual Studio that works in all editions of Visual Studio. Visual Studio also provides support for Python and F# integration.  

### Install R Tools to an Existing Visual Studio edition

To download the tools and view related documentation and samples, see [Install R Tools for Visual Studio](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/installation.html).

> [!NOTE]
> Requires Visual Studio 2015 Community, Professional or Enterprise, Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, and an R interpreter, such as Microsoft R Open
 
  
### Install Visual Studio  

If you do not have Visual Studio, we recommend that you install the free Community Edition of Visual Studio.   

1.  Download the free Community edition of Visual Studio from this page: [Visual Studio Community](http://visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)  
  
2.  When the download completes, click **Run** and select the components to install.  
  
     Important: If you do a custom setup, note that the Microsoft Web Developer components are required.  
  
3.  Choose the **General** setting if you don't have other preferences. When you install [!INCLUDE[rsql_rtvs](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-rtvs-md.md)], you'll have the option to change to a layout customized for R development.  

#### Add the R Tools

After Visual Studio is installed, extensions are available for R, Python, and many other languages through the **Options** menu.

1. Click **Tools**, and select **Extensions and Updates**. 
2. Click **Online**, click **Visual Studio Gallery**, and then click **Tools**.
3. Select **Programming Languages** and locate **R Tools for Visual Studio** in the list.
4. Near the end of installation, R Tools will detect the versions of the R runtime that are available on the computer, and ask if you want to change your development environment to use the R runtime for Microsoft R Server or the R runtime for Microsoft R Client.
5. If R Tools setup does not detect the R Server runtime you want to use, you can change it manually at any time by using the **Options** menu in Visual Studio. For  more information, see [Configure Your IDE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/r-client-get-started#step-2-configure-your-ide).

> [!TIP]
> Before you install any new packages, check which R runtime is being used by default. Otherwise it can be very easy to install new R packages to a default library location and then not be able to find them from R Server!


## RStudio

If you prefer to use RStudio, some additional steps are required to use the RevoScaleR libraries:
- Install either Microsoft R Server or Microsoft R Client to get the required packages and libraries.
- Update your R path to use the R Server runtime.

For more information, see [Configure Your IDE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/r-client-get-started#step-2-configure-your-ide).
