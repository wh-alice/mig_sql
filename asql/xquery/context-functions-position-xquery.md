# Context Functions - position (XQuery)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns an integer value that indicates the position of the context item within the sequence of items currently being processed.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
fn:position() as xs:integer  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], **fn:position()** can only be used in the context of a context-dependent predicate. Specifically, it can only be used inside brackets ([ ]).Comparing against this function does not reduce the cardinality during static type inference.  
  
## Examples  
 This topic provides XQuery examples against XML instances that are stored in various **xml** type columns in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
### A. Using the position() XQuery function to retrieve the first two product features  
 The following query retrieves the first two features, the first two child elements of the <`Features`> element, from the product model catalog description. If there are more features, it adds a <`there-is-more/`> element to the result.  
  
```  
SELECT CatalogDescription.query('  
     declare namespace pd="http://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ProductModelDescription";  
     <Product>   
          { /pd:ProductDescription/@ProductModelID }  
          { /pd:ProductDescription/@ProductModelName }   
          {  
            for $f in /pd:ProductDescription/pd:Features/*[position()<=2]  
            return  
            $f   
          }  
          {  
            if (count(/pd:ProductDescription/pd:Features/*) > 2)  
            then <there-is-more/>  
            else ()  
          }   
     </Product>          
') as x  
FROM Production.ProductModel  
WHERE CatalogDescription is not null  
```  
  
 Note the following from the previous query:  
  
-   The **namespace** keyword in the [XQuery Prolog](../Topic/XQuery%20Prolog.md) defines a namespace prefix that is used in the query body.  
  
-   The query body constructs XML that has a \<Product> element with **ProductModelID** and **ProductModelName** attributes, and has product features returned as child elements.  
  
-   The **position()** function is used in the predicate to determine the position of the \<Features> child element in context. If it is the first or second feature, it is returned.  
  
-   The IF statement adds a \<there-is-more/> element to the result if there are more than two features in the product catalog.  
  
-   Because not all product models have their catalog descriptions stored in the table, the WHERE clause is used to discard rows where CatalogDescriptions is NULL.  
  
 This is a partial result:  
  
```  
<Product ProductModelID="19" ProductModelName="Mountain 100">  
  <p1:Warranty xmlns:p1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ProductModelWarrAndMain">
