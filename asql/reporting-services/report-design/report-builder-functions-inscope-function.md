# Report Builder Functions - InScope Function
  Indicates whether the current instance of an item is in the specified scope.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../reporting-services/report-builder/includes/ssrbrddup-md.md)]  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
InScope(scope)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *scope*  
 (**String**) The name of a dataset, data region, or group that specifies a scope.  
  
## Return Type  
 Returns a **Boolean**.  
  
## Remarks  
 The **InScope** function tests the scope of the current instance of a report item for membership in the scope specified by the *scope*parameter.  
  
 *Scope* cannot be an expression.  
  
 A typical use for the **InScope** function is in data regions that have dynamic scoping. For example, **InScope** can be used in a drillthrough link in a data region cells to provide a different report name and different sets of parameters depending on which cell is clicked. An example of this is as follows:  
  
-   The following expression, used as the report name in a drillthrough link, opens the `ProductDetail` report if the clicked cell is in the `Month` group, and the `ProductSummary` report if it is not.  
  
    ```  
    =Iif(InScope("Month"), "ProductDetail", "ProductSummary")  
    ```  
  
-   The following expression, used in the **Omit** property of a drillthrough report parameter, will pass the parameter to the target report only if the clicked cell is in the `Product` group.  
  
    ```  
    =Not(InScope("Product"))  
    ```

## Example  
 The following code example indicates whether the current instance of the item is in the `Product` dataset, data region, or group scope.  
  
```  
=InScope("Product")  
```
