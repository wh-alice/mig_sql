# Specify a Unary Operator (Business Intelligence Wizard)
  Use the **Specify a Unary Operator** page to identify the parent-child relationship for the column that contains either a unary operator (for regular aggregations) or a value representing a weight factor (for weighted aggregations.) For more information about regular and weighted aggregations, see [Aggregations and Aggregation Designs](../analysis-services/multidimensional-models-olap-logical-cube-objects/aggregations-and-aggregation-designs.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This page does not appear if the Business Intelligence Wizard was started from Dimension Designer or by right-clicking a dimension in Solution Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
## Options  
 **Key attribute**  
 Displays the key attribute of the selected dimension.  
  
 **Parent attribute**  
 Displays the parent attribute with which to associate the source column that contains the unary operator or weight factor.  
  
 **Source column**  
 Select the source column that contains the unary operator or weight factor.
