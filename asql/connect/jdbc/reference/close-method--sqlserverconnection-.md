# close Method (SQLServerConnection)
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../../connect/jdbc/includes)]

  Releases this [SQLServerConnection](../../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverconnection-class.md) object's database and JDBC resources immediately instead of waiting for them to be automatically released.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
public void close()  
```  
  
## Exceptions  
 [SQLServerException](../../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverexception-class.md)  
  
## Remarks  
 This close method is specified by the close method in the java.sql.Connection interface.  
  
 Calling the close method in the middle of a transaction causes the transaction to be rolled back.
