# MSSQLSERVER_7711
  
## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|7711|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|PRT_RANGE_OVERLAP|  
|Message Text|The DATA_COMPRESSION option was specified more than once for the table or index or one of its partitions.|  
  
## Explanation  
An error occurred in the DATA_COMPRESSION option in one of the following statements:  
  
-   CREATE TABLE  
  
-   ALTER TABLE  
  
-   CREATE INDEX  
  
-   ALTER INDEX  
  
If the table or index cited is partitioned, the DATA_COMPRESSION option was listed more than one time for at least one of the partitions. If the table or index is not partitioned, the DATA_COMPRESSION option was cited more than one time.  
  
## User Action  
For a partitioned table or index, make sure that the DATA_COMPRESSION option is specified only one time for each partition. For a table or index that is not partitioned, use the DATA_COMPRESSION option only one time in the statement.
