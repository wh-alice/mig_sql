# SET STATISTICS IO (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to display information regarding the amount of disk activity generated by [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
SET STATISTICS IO { ON | OFF }  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 When STATISTICS IO is ON, statistical information is displayed. When OFF, the information is not displayed.  
  
 After this option is set ON, all subsequent [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements return the statistical information until the option is set to OFF.  
  
 The following table lists and describes the output items.  
  
|Output item|Meaning|  
|-----------------|-------------|  
|**Table**|Name of the table.|  
|**Scan count**|Number of seeks/scans started after reaching the leaf level in any direction to retrieve all the values to construct the final dataset for the output.<br /><br /> Scan count is 0 if the index used is a unique index or clustered index on a primary key and you are seeking for only one value. For example `WHERE Primary_Key_Column = <value>`.<br /><br /> Scant count is 1 when you are searching for one value using a non-unique clustered index which is defined on a non-primary key column. This is done to check for duplicate values for the key value that you are searching for. For example `WHERE Clustered_Index_Key_Column = <value>`.<br /><br /> Scan count is N when N is the number of different seek/scan started towards the left or right side at the leaf level after locating a key value using the index key.|  
|**logical reads**|Number of pages read from the data cache.|  
|**physical reads**|Number of pages read from disk.|  
|**read-ahead reads**|Number of pages placed into the cache for the query.|  
|**lob logical reads**|Number of **text**, **ntext**, **image**, or large value type (**varchar(max)**, **nvarchar(max)**, **varbinary(max)**) pages read from the data cache.|  
|**lob physical reads**|Number of **text**, **ntext**, **image** or large value type pages read from disk.|  
|**lob read-ahead reads**|Number of **text**, **ntext**, **image** or large value type pages placed into the cache for the query.|  
  
 The setting of SET STATISTICS IO is set at execute or run time and not at parse time.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When Transact-SQL statements retrieve LOB columns, some LOB retrieval operations might require traversing the LOB tree multiple times. This may cause SET STATISTICS IO to report higher than expected logical reads.  
  
## Permissions  
 To use SET STATISTICS IO, users must have the appropriate permissions to execute the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement. The SHOWPLAN permission is not required.  
  
## Examples  
 This example shows how many logical and physical reads are used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as it processes the statements.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO         
SET STATISTICS IO ON;  
GO  
SELECT *   
FROM Production.ProductCostHistory  
WHERE StandardCost < 500.00;  
GO  
SET STATISTICS IO OFF;  
GO  
```  
  
 Here is the result set:  
  
```  
Table 'ProductCostHistory'. Scan count 1, logical reads 5, physical   
reads 0, read-ahead reads 0, lob logical reads 0, lob physical reads 0,   
lob read-ahead reads 0.  
```
