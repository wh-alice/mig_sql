## Arguments  
 [ **@tabname =**] **'***tabname***'**  
 Is the qualified or nonqualified name of the table for which the spatial index has been specified.  
  
 Quotation marks are required only if a qualified table is specified. If a fully qualified name, including a database name, is provided, the database name must be the name of the current database. *tabname* is **nvarchar**(776), with no default.  
  
 [ **@indexname =** ] **'***indexname***'**  
 Is the name of the spatial index specified. *indexname* is **sysname** with no default.  
  
 [ **@verboseoutput =** ] **'***verboseoutput***'**  
 Is the range of property names and values to be returned.  
  
 0 = core properties  
  
 \>0 = all properties  
  
 *verboseoutput* is **tinyint** with no default.  
  
 [ **@query_sample =** ] **'***query_sample***'**  
 Is a representative query sample that can be used to test the usefulness of the index. It may be a representative object or a query window. *query_sample* is **geometry** with no default.  
  
 [ **@xml_output =** ] **'***xml_output***'**  
 Is an output parameter that returns the result set in an XML fragment. *xml_output* is **xml** with no default.  
  
## Properties  
 Set **@verboseoutput** =0 to return core properties as shown in the table below; **@verboseoutput** > 0 to return all properties of the spatial index.  
  
 **Base_Table_Rows**  
 Number of rows in the base table. Value is **bigint**.  
  
 **Bounding_Box_xmin**  
 X-minimum bounding box properties of the spatial index for **geometry** type. This property value is NULL for **geography**type. Value is **float**.  
  
 **Bounding_Box_ymin**  
 Y-minimum bounding box properties of the spatial index for **geometry** type. This property value is NULL for **geography** type. Value is **float**.  
  
 **Bounding_Box_xmax**  
 X-maximum bounding box properties of the spatial index for **geometry** type. This property value is NULL for **geography** type. Value is **float**.  
  
 **Bounding_Box_ymax**  
 Y-maximum bounding box properties of the spatial index for **geometry** type. This property value is NULL for **geography** type. Value is **float**.  
  
 **Grid_Size_Level_1**  
 Level 1 grid density of the spatial index:  
  
 16 for LOW  
  
 64 for MEDIUM  
  
 256 for HIGH  
  
 Value is **int**.  
  
 **Grid_Size_Level_2**  
 Level 2 grid density of the spatial index:  
  
 16 for LOW  
  
 64 for MEDIUM  
  
 256 for HIGH  
  
 Value is **int**.  
  
 **Grid_Size_Level_3**  
 Level 3 grid density of the spatial index:  
  
 16 for LOW  
  
 64 for MEDIUM  
  
 256 for HIGH  
  
 Value is **int**.  
  
 **Grid_Size_Level_4**  
 Level 4 grid density of the spatial index:  
  
 16 for LOW  
  
 64 for MEDIUM  
  
 256 for HIGH  
  
 Value is **int**.  
  
 **Cells_Per_Object**  
 Number of cells per object (index property). Value is **int**.  
  
 **Total_Primary_Index_Rows**  
 Number of rows in the index. Value is **bigint**.  
  
 **Total_Primary_Index_Pages**  
 Number of pages in the index. Value is **bigint**.  
  
 **Average_Number_Of_Index_Rows_Per_Base_Row**  
 Number of index rows / number base table rows. Value is **bigint**.  
  
 **Total_Number_Of_ObjectCells_In_Level0_For_QuerySample**  
 Indicates whether the representative query sample falls outside of the bounding box of the **geometry** index and into the root cell (level 0 cell). This is either 0 (not in level 0 cell) or 1. If it is in the level 0 cell, the investigated index is not an appropriate index for the query sample. This is a core property. Value is **bigint**.  
  
 **Total_Number_Of_ObjectCells_In_Level0_In_Index**  
 Number of cell instances of indexed objects that are tessellated in level 0 (root cell, outside the bounding box for **geometry**). This is a core property. Value is **bigint**.  
  
 For **geometry** indexes, this will occur if the bounding box of the index is smaller than the data domain. A high number of objects in level 0 may require secondary filters if the query window falls partially outside the bounding box and will decrease the index performance (for example, **Total_Number_Of_ObjectCells_In_Level0_For_QuerySample** is 1). If the query window falls inside the bounding box, a high number of objects in level 0 may actually improve the performance of the index.  
  
 NULL and empty instances are counted at level 0 but will not impact performance. Level 0 will have as many cells as NULL and empty instances at the base table. For **geography** indexes, level 0 will have as many cells as NULL and empty instances +1 cell, because the query sample is counted as 1.  
  
 **Total_Number_Of_ObjectCells_In_Level1_In_Index**  
 Number of cell instances of indexed objects that are tessellated with level 1 precision. This is a core property. Value is **bigint**.  
  
 **Total_Number_Of_ObjectCells_In_Level2_In_Index**

 **Total_Number_Of_interior_ObjectCells_In_Level1_In_Index**

 **Total_Number_Of_intersecting_ObjectCells_In_Level3_In_Index**  
 Number of cells that are intersected by an object at tessellation level 3. (Cell_attribute value is 1.) This is a core property. Value is **bigint**.

 Number of cells that are intersected by an object at tessellation level 4. (Cell_attribute value is 1.) This is a core property. Value is **bigint**.  
  
 **Total_Number_Of_Border_ObjectCells_In_Level0_For_QuerySample**  
 Indicates whether the query sample is in the root cell 0 outside the bounding box, but touching it. This is a core property. Value is **bigint**.

 **Interior_To_Total_Cells_Normalized_To_Leaf_Grid_Percentage**  
 Percentage of the total area (total leaf cells) of the grid that contain leaf cells covered by an object.  
  
 For example, an object is tessellated into 10 cells at the 4 different grid levels covering an area that is equivalent to 100 leaf cells in total. Suppose there are 3 interior cells that are completely covered by the object. The area covered by the 3 interior cells is equivalent to 42 leaf cells. Thus, the percentage of covered area is 42 percent. This is a good measure of how well the objects in the index are shredded.

 Number of rows selected by the primary filter. This is a core property. Value is **bigint.**  
  
 **Number_Of_Rows_Selected_By_Internal_Filter**  
 Number of rows selected by the internal filter. The secondary filter is not called for these rows. This is a core property. Value is **bigint.**  
  
 The returned number is only applicable for **STintersects**.  
  
 **Number_Of_Times_Secondary_Filter_Is_Called**

 **Percentage_Of_Primary_Filter_Rows_Selected_By_internal_Filter**  
 If P rows are selected by the primary filter and S rows are selected by the internal filter, this returns S/P as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the better the index is in avoiding the more performance-expensive secondary filter. This is a core property. Value is **float.**
