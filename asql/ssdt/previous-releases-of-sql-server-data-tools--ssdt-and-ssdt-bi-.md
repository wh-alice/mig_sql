# Previous releases of SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT and SSDT-BI)
SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) provides project templates and design surfaces for building SQL Server content types â€” relational databases, Analysis Services models, Reporting Services reports, and Integration Services packages.  
  
It's based on a Visual Studio shell and co-released with SQL Server. New versions of SSDT integrate the very latest features  of SQL Server. Older versions include the templates and design environment that were current for that release.  
  
SSDT is backwards compatible, which means you can always use [the newest SSDT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204009.aspx) to design and deploy databases, models, reports, and packages that run on older versions of SQL Server. You can also use any of  the previously released versions listed below.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Historically, the Visual Studio shell used to create SQL Server content types has been released under various names, including **SQL Server Data Tools**, **SQL Server Data Tools - Business Intelligence**, and **Business Intelligence Development Studio**. Previous versions came with distinct sets of project templates. To get all of the project templates together in one SSDT, you need [the newest version](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204009.aspx). Otherwise, you will probably need to install multiple previous versions to get all of the templates used in SQL Server.  Only one shell will be installed per version of Visual Studio; installing a second SSDT just adds the missing templates.

Visual Studio 2013 customers can download a preview version of SSDT to try out new features that are not yet in the product release version.  
  
**SQL BI: Analysis Services, Reporting Services, Integration services**  
  
BI templates are used to create SSAS models, SSRS reports, and SSIS packages. BI Designers are tied to specific releases of SQL Server. To use the newer BI features, install a newer versioned BI designer.
