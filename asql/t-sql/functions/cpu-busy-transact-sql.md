# @@CPU_BUSY (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns the time that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has spent working since it was last started. Result is in CPU time increments, or "ticks," and is cumulative for all CPUs, so it may exceed the actual elapsed time. Multiply by @@TIMETICKS to convert to microseconds.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If the time returned in @@CPU_BUSY or @@IO_BUSY exceeds approximately 49 days of cumulative CPU time, you receive an arithmetic overflow warning. In that case, the value of @@CPU_BUSY, @@IO_BUSY and @@IDLE variables are not accurate.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
@@CPU_BUSY  
```  
  
## Return Types  
 **integer**  
  
## Remarks  
 To display a report containing several [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] statistics, including CPU activity, run [sp_monitor](../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-monitor-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows returning [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] CPU activity as of the current date and time. To avoid arithmetic overflow when converting the value to microseconds, the example converts one of the values to the `float` data type.  
  
```  
SELECT @@CPU_BUSY * CAST(@@TIMETICKS AS float) AS 'CPU microseconds',   
   GETDATE() AS 'As of' ;  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 `CPU microseconds As of`
