# Interactive Functionality for Different Report Rendering Extensions (Report Builder and SSRS)
  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] provides features for interacting with a paginated report at run time. Not all of the report rendering formats support the full range of interactive features. Use the following table to understand how each interactive feature works in specific formats.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../a9retired/includes/ssrbrddup-md.md)]  
  
## Interactive Features in Different Output Formats  
 Paginated reports that are rendered to XML, CSV, or Image formats do not support interactive features.  
  
 Reports that you view in the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] web portal, SharePoint Web parts, or in a browser are rendered in HTML. HTML and Windows Forms are the only report output formats that fully support all interactive features. Alternate HTML formats (such as MHTML) support many interactive features. If exceptions for MHTML exist, they are noted in the following table.
