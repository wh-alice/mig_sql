# @@IO_BUSY (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns the time that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has spent performing input and output operations since [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] was last started. The result is in CPU time increments ("ticks"), and is cumulative for all CPUs, so it may exceed the actual elapsed time. Multiply by @@TIMETICKS to convert to microseconds.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If the time returned in @@CPU_BUSY, or @@IO_BUSY exceeds approximately 49 days of cumulative CPU time, you receive an arithmetic overflow warning. In that case, the value of @@CPU_BUSY, @@IO_BUSY and @@IDLE variables are not accurate.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
@@IO_BUSY  
```  
  
## Return Types  
 **integer**  
  
## Remarks  
 To display a report containing several [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] statistics, run sp_monitor.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows returning the number of milliseconds [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has spent performing input/output operations between the start time and the current time. To avoid arithmetic overflow when converting the value to microseconds, the example converts one of the values to the **float** data type.  
  
```  
SELECT @@IO_BUSY*@@TIMETICKS AS 'IO microseconds',   
   GETDATE() AS 'as of';  
```  
  
 Here is a typical result set:  
  
```  
  
IO microseconds as of
