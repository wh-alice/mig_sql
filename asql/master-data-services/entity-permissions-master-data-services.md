# Entity Permissions (Master Data Services)
  Entity permissions apply to:  
  
-   All of the entity's attributes, including **Name** and **Code**, for both leaf and consolidated members.  
  
-   All of the entityâ€™s collections.  
  
-   Explicit hierarchy memberships and relationships.  
  
 When you have permission to an entity, you can add and remove members from the entity, its explicit hierarchies, and its collections.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  These permissions apply to the **Explorer** functional area of the user interface only.  
  
|Permission|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**Read**|User can read members, attributes, hierarchy memberships, or collection memberships.|  
|**Create**|User can create members, and assign attribute values during create.|  
|**Update**|User can update members, attributes, hierarchy memberships, or collection memberships.|  
|**Delete**|User can delete members.|  
|**Deny**|Deny all access to the entity.|  
  
 The Read, Create, Update, and Delete permissions can be combined with each other. When Create, Update and Delete permissions are assigned, the read permission will be assigned automatically.
