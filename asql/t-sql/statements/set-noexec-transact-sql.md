# SET NOEXEC (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Compiles each query but does not execute it.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
SET NOEXEC { ON | OFF }  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 When SET NOEXEC is ON, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] compiles each batch of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements but does not execute them. When SET NOEXEC is OFF, all batches are executed after compilation.  
  
 The execution of statements in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has two phases: compilation and execution. This setting is useful for having [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] validate the syntax and object names in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] code when executing. It is also useful for debugging statements that would generally be part of a larger batch of statements.  
  
 The setting of SET NOEXEC is set at execute or run time and not at parse time.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires membership in the public role.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses `NOEXEC` with a valid query, a query with an object name that is not valid, and a query with incorrect syntax.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
PRINT 'Valid query';  
GO  
-- SET NOEXEC to ON.  
SET NOEXEC ON;  
GO  
-- Inner join.  
SELECT e.BusinessEntityID, e.JobTitle, v.Name  
FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e   
   INNER JOIN Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader AS poh  
   ON e.BusinessEntityID = poh.EmployeeID  
   INNER JOIN Purchasing.Vendor AS v  
   ON poh.VendorID = v.BusinessEntityID;  
GO  
-- SET NOEXEC to OFF.  
SET NOEXEC OFF;  
GO  
  
PRINT 'Invalid object name';  
GO  
-- SET NOEXEC to ON.  
SET NOEXEC ON;  
GO  
-- Function name uses is a reserved keyword.  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.Values(@BusinessEntityID int)  
RETURNS TABLE  
AS  
RETURN (SELECT PurchaseOrderID, TotalDue  
   FROM dbo.PurchaseOrderHeader  
   WHERE VendorID = @BusinessEntityID);  
  
-- SET NOEXEC to OFF.  
SET NOEXEC OFF;  
GO  
  
PRINT 'Invalid syntax';  
GO  
-- SET NOEXEC to ON.  
SET NOEXEC ON;  
GO  
-- Built-in function incorrectly invoked.  
SELECT *  
FROM fn_helpcollations;  
-- Reset SET NOEXEC to OFF.  
SET NOEXEC OFF;  
GO  
```
