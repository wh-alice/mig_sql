# Maintenance Plan (Reporting and Logging Page)
  Use the **Reporting and Logging** dialog box to configure the reports and logs that are generated when maintenance plans are executed.

 **Create a new file**  
 Create a new report file for each execution of the maintenance plan. By default, the report files are written to the computer hosting the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that contains this maintenance plan, in the folder established as the default log folder during [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setup.
