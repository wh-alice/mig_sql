# Lesson 2-3 - Maximizing Query Editor
Programmers frequently ask, "How can I get more room to write my code?" The answer is that there are two ways, both easy: maximize the Query Editor window and hide your unused tool windows.  
  
## Maximizing the Query Editor Window  
  
#### To maximize the Query Editor window  
  
1.  Click anywhere in the Query Editor window.  
  
2.  Press SHIFT+ALT+ENTER to toggle between full-screen mode and regular mode.  
  
    This keyboard shortcut works with any document window.  
  
## Hiding Tool Windows  
  
#### To automatically hide all tool windows  
  
1.  Click anywhere in the Query Editor window.  
  
2.  On the **Window** menu, click **Auto Hide All**.  
  
3.  To restore the tool windows, open each tool, and then click the **Auto Hide** button on the window to pin it open.
