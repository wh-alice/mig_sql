# Set the AUTO_CLOSE Database Option to OFF
  This rule checks whether the AUTO_ CLOSE option is set OFF. When AUTO_CLOSE is set ON, this option can cause performance degradation on frequently accessed databases because of the increased overhead of opening and closing the database after each connection. AUTO_CLOSE also flushes the procedure cache after each connection.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 If a database is accessed frequently, set the AUTO_CLOSE option to OFF for the database.
