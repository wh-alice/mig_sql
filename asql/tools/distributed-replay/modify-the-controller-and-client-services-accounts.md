# Modify the Controller and Client Services Accounts
  In this topic, you will learn how to modify the Distributed Replay controller and client service accounts, and then reapply the access control lists (ACLs).  
  
### To start or stop the Distributed Replay services using Computer Management  
  
1.  On the computer on which the Distributed Replay services are installed, from the command prompt, type **dcomcnfg**.  
  
2.  Double-click **Services**, scroll down and right-click **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay \<service name>**, and then click **Start** or **Stop**.  
  
### To modify the Distributed Replay controller service  
  
1.  On the controller computer, stop the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay controller service.  
  
2.  Under **Services**, right-click **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay Controller**, and then select **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay Controller Properties** window, on the **Log On** tab, select **This account**, type or click **Browse** to enter the new logon account, and then click **OK**.  
  
     **Important**: When you configure Distributed Replay Controller, you can specify one or more user accounts that will be used to run the Distributed Replay Client services. The following is the list of supported accounts:  
  
    -   Domain user account  
  
    -   User created local user account  
  
    -   Administrator  
  
    -   Virtual account and MSA (Managed Service Account)  
  
    -   Network Services, Local Services, and System  
  
     Group accounts (local or domain) and other built-in accounts (like Everyone) are not accepted.  
  
4.  Start the Distributed Replay controller service.  
  
### To modify the Distributed Replay client service  
  
1.  Before you modify the Distributed Replay client service, make sure the client service account you are changing was specified during setup (in the CTLRUSERS parameter on the controller computer). If the client service account you are changing was not specified during setup, you must perform the following steps first:  
  
    1.  Stop the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay controller service.  
  
    2.  On the controller computer on which the controller service is installed, from the command prompt, type **dcomcnfg**.  
  
    3.  In the **Component Services** window, navigate to **Console Root -> Component Services -> Computers -> My Computer -> DCOM Config ->DReplayController**.  
  
    4.  Right-click **DReplayController**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
    5.  In the **DReplayController Properties** window, on the **Security** tab, click **Edit** in the **Launch and Activation Permissions** section.  
  
    6.  Grant the new client service logon account **Local and Remote activation** permissions, and then click **OK**.  
  
    7.  Click **Edit** in the **Access Permissions** section, and grant the new client service logon account **Local and Remote access** permissions, and then click **OK**.  
  
    8.  Click **OK** to close the **DReplayController Properties** window.  
  
    9. On the controller computer, add the changed client service logon account to the **Distributed COM Users** group.  
  
    10. Start the SQL Server Distributed Replay controller service.  
  
2.  Stop the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay client service.  
  
3.  In the **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay Client Properties** window, on the **Log On** tab, select **This account**, type or click **Browse** to enter the new logon account, and then click **OK**.  
  
4.  Start the Distributed Replay client service.
