# CHECKPOINT (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Generates a manual checkpoint in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database to which you are currently connected.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For information about different types of database checkpoints and checkpoint operation in general, see [Database Checkpoints &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/logs/database-checkpoints-sql-server.md).

|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [current version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299658)).|

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
CHECKPOINT [ checkpoint_duration ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *checkpoint_duration*  
 Specifies the requested amount of time, in seconds, for the manual checkpoint to complete. When *checkpoint_duration* is specified, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] attempts to perform the checkpoint within the requested duration. The *checkpoint_duration* must be an expression of type **int** and must be greater than zero. When this parameter is omitted, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] adjusts the checkpoint duration to minimize the performance impact on database applications. *checkpoint_duration* is an advanced option.  
  
## Factors Affecting the Duration of Checkpoint Operations  
 In general, the amount time required for a checkpoint operation increases with the number of dirty pages that the operation must write. By default, to minimize the performance impact on other applications, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] adjusts the frequency of writes that a checkpoint operation performs. Decreasing the write frequency increases the time the checkpoint operation requires to complete. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses this strategy for a manual checkpoint unless a *checkpoint_duration* value is specified in the CHECKPOINT command.  
  
 The performance impact of using *checkpoint_duration* depends on the number of dirty pages, the activity on the system, and the actual duration specified. For example, if the checkpoint would normally complete in 120 seconds, specifying a *checkpoint_duration* of 45 seconds causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to devote more resources to the checkpoint than would be assigned by default. In contrast, specifying a *checkpoint_duration* of 180 seconds would cause [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to assign fewer resources than would be assigned by default. In general, a short *checkpoint_duration* will increase the resources devoted to the checkpoint, while a long *checkpoint_duration* will reduce the resources devoted to the checkpoint. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] always completes a checkpoint if possible, and the CHECKPOINT statement returns immediately when a checkpoint completes. Therefore, in some cases, a checkpoint may complete sooner than the specified duration or may run longer than the specified duration.

### Permissions  
 CHECKPOINT permissions default to members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role and the **db_owner** and **db_backupoperator** fixed database roles, and are not transferable.
