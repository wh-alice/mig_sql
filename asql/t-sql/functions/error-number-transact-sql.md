# ERROR_NUMBER (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns the error number of the error that caused the CATCH block of a TRYâ€¦CATCH construct to be run.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
-- Syntax for SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
ERROR_NUMBER ( )  
```  
  
## Return Types  
 **int**  
  
## Return Value  
 When called in a CATCH block, returns the error number of the error message that caused the CATCH block to be run.  
  
 Returns NULL if called outside the scope of a CATCH block.  
  
## Remarks  
 This function may be called anywhere within the scope of a CATCH block.  
  
 ERROR_NUMBER returns the error number regardless of how many times it is run, or where it is run within the scope of the CATCH block. This is in contrast to @@ERROR, which only returns the error number in the statement immediately after the one that causes an error, or the first statement of a CATCH block.  
  
 In nested CATCH blocks, ERROR_NUMBER returns the error number specific to the scope of the CATCH block in which it is referenced. For example, the CATCH block of an outer TRY...CATCH construct could have a nested TRY...CATCH construct. Within the nested CATCH block, ERROR_NUMBER returns the number from the error that invoked the nested CATCH block. If ERROR_NUMBER is run in the outer CATCH block, it returns the number from the error that invoked that CATCH block.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using ERROR_NUMBER in a CATCH block  
 The following code example shows a `SELECT` statement that generates a divide-by-zero error. The number of the error is returned.  
  
```  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Generate a divide-by-zero error.  
    SELECT 1/0;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Using ERROR_NUMBER in a CATCH block with other error-handling tools  
 The following code example shows a `SELECT` statement that generates a divide-by-zero error. Along with the error number, information that relates to the error is returned.  
  
```  
  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Generate a divide-by-zero error.  
    SELECT 1/0;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT  
        ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber,  
        ERROR_SEVERITY() AS ErrorSeverity,  
        ERROR_STATE() AS ErrorState,  
        ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS ErrorProcedure,  
        ERROR_LINE() AS ErrorLine,  
        ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
```  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
  
### C. Using ERROR_NUMBER in a CATCH block  
 The following code example shows a `SELECT` statement that generates a divide-by-zero error. The number of the error is returned.  
  
```  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Generate a divide-by-zero error.  
    SELECT 1/0;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
```  
  
### D. Using ERROR_NUMBER in a CATCH block with other error-handling tools  
 The following code example shows a `SELECT` statement that generates a divide-by-zero error. Along with the error number, information that relates to the error is returned.  
  
```  
  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Generate a divide-by-zero error.  
    SELECT 1/0;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT  
        ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber,  
        ERROR_SEVERITY() AS ErrorSeverity,  
        ERROR_STATE() AS ErrorState,  
        ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS ErrorProcedure,  
        ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
```
