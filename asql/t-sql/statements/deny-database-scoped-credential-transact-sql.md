## Syntax  
  
```  
  
DENY permission  [ ,...n ]   
    ON DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL :: credential_name   
    TO principal [ ,...n ]  
    [ CASCADE ]  
    [ AS denying_principal ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be denied on a database scoped credential. Listed below.  
  
 ON DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL **::***credential_name*  
 Specifies the database scoped credential on which the permission is being denied. The scope qualifier "::" is required.  
  
 *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is being denied. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being denied is also denied to other principals to which it has been granted by this principal.  
  
 *denying_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to deny the permission. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
## Remarks  
 A database scoped credential is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on a database scoped credential are listed below, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Database scoped credential permission|Implied by database scoped credential permission|Implied by database permission|  
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the database scoped credential. If the AS clause is used, the specified principal must own the database scoped credential.
