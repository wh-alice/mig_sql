# DECRYPTBYKEYAUTOASYMKEY (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Decrypts using a symmetric key that is automatically decrypted using an asymmetric key.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
DecryptByKeyAutoAsymKey ( akey_ID , akey_password   
    , { 'ciphertext' | @ciphertext }  
  [ , { add_authenticator | @add_authenticator }   
  [ , { authenticator | @authenticator } ] ] )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *akey_ID*  
 Is the ID of the asymmetric key that is used to protect the symmetric key. *akey_ID* is **int**.  
  
 *akey_password*  
 Is the password that protects the private key of the asymmetric key. Can be NULL if the private key is protected by the database master key. *akey_password* is **nvarchar**.  
  
 '*ciphertext*'  
 Is the data that was encrypted with the key. *ciphertext* is **varbinary**.  
  
 @ciphertext  
 Is a variable of type **varbinary** that contains data that was encrypted with the key.  
  
 *add_authenticator*  
 Indicates whether an authenticator was encrypted together with the plaintext. Must be the same value that is passed to EncryptByKey when encrypting the data. Is 1 if an authenticator was used. *add_authenticator* is **int**.  
  
 @add_authenticator  
 Indicates whether an authenticator was encrypted together with the plaintext. Must be the same value that is passed to EncryptByKey when encrypting the data.  
  
 *authenticator*  
 Is the data from which to generate an authenticator. Must match the value that was supplied to EncryptByKey. *authenticator* is **sysname**.  
  
 @authenticator  
 Is a variable that contains data from which to generate an authenticator. Must match the value that was supplied to EncryptByKey.  
  
## Return Types  
 **varbinary** with a maximum size of 8,000 bytes.  
  
## Remarks  
 DecryptByKeyAutoAsymKey combines the functionality of OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY and DecryptByKey. In a single operation, it decrypts a symmetric key and uses that key to decrypt ciphertext.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires VIEW DEFINITION permission on the symmetric key and CONTROL permission on the asymmetric key.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows how `DecryptByKeyAutoAsymKey` can be used to simplify code that performs a decryption. This code should be run on an [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database that does not already have a database master key.  
  
```  
--Create the keys and certificate.  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'mzkvdMlk979438teag$$ds987yghn)(*&4fdg^';  
OPEN MASTER KEY DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'mzkvdMlk979438teag$$ds987yghn)(*&4fdg^';  
CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY SSN_AKey   
    WITH ALGORITHM = RSA_2048 ;   
GO  
CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY SSN_Key_02 WITH ALGORITHM = DES  
    ENCRYPTION BY ASYMMETRIC KEY SSN_AKey;  
GO  
--  
--Add a column of encrypted data.  
ALTER TABLE HumanResources.Employee  
    ADD EncryptedNationalIDNumber2 varbinary(128);   
OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY SSN_Key_02  
   DECRYPTION BY ASYMMETRIC KEY SSN_AKey;  
UPDATE HumanResources.Employee  
SET EncryptedNationalIDNumber2  
    = EncryptByKey(Key_GUID('SSN_Key_02'), NationalIDNumber);  
GO  
--Close the key used to encrypt the data.  
CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY SSN_Key_02;  
--  
--There are two ways to decrypt the stored data.  
--  
--OPTION ONE, using DecryptByKey()  
--1. Open the symmetric key.  
--2. Decrypt the data.  
--3. Close the symmetric key.  
OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY SSN_Key_02  
   DECRYPTION BY ASYMMETRIC KEY SSN_AKey;  
SELECT NationalIDNumber, EncryptedNationalIDNumber2    
    AS 'Encrypted ID Number',  
    CONVERT(nvarchar, DecryptByKey(EncryptedNationalIDNumber2))   
    AS 'Decrypted ID Number'  
    FROM HumanResources.Employee;  
CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY SSN_Key_02;  
--  
--OPTION TWO, using DecryptByKeyAutoAsymKey()  
SELECT NationalIDNumber, EncryptedNationalIDNumber2   
    AS 'Encrypted ID Number',  
    CONVERT(nvarchar, DecryptByKeyAutoAsymKey ( AsymKey_ID('SSN_AKey') , NULL ,EncryptedNationalIDNumber2))   
    AS 'Decrypted ID Number'  
    FROM HumanResources.Employee;  
GO  
```
