# Delete a Publication
  This topic describes how to delete a publication in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)], or Replication Management Objects (RMO).  
  
 **In This Topic**  
  
-   **To delete a publication, using:**  
  
     [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMSProcedure)  
  
     [Transact-SQL](#TsqlProcedure)  
  
     [Replication Management Objects (RMO)](#RMOProcedure)  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
 Delete publications from the **Local Publications** folder in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
#### To delete a publication  
  
1.  Connect to the Publisher in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], and then expand the server node.  
  
2.  Expand the **Replication** folder, and then expand the **Local Publications** folder.  
  
3.  Right-click the publication you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
 Publications can be deleted programmatically using replication stored procedures. The stored procedures that you use depend on the type of publication being deleted.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Deleting a publication does not remove published objects from the publication database or the corresponding objects from the subscription database. Use the `DROP <object>` command to manually remove these objects if necessary.  
  
#### To delete a snapshot or transactional publication  
  
1.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   To delete a single publication, execute [sp_droppublication](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-droppublication-transact-sql.md) at the Publisher on the publication database.  
  
    -   To delete all publications in and remove all replication objects from a published database, execute [sp_removedbreplication](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-removedbreplication-transact-sql.md) at the Publisher. Specify a value of **tran** for **@type**. (Optional) If the Distributor cannot be accessed or if the status of the database is suspect or offline, specify a value of **1** for **@force**. (Optional) Specify the name of the database for **@dbname** if [sp_removedbreplication](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-removedbreplication-transact-sql.md) is not executed on the publication database.  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  Specifying a value of **1** for **@force** may leave replication-related publishing objects in the database.  
  
2.  (Optional) If this database has no other publications, execute [sp_replicationdboption &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-replicationdboption-transact-sql.md) to disable publication of the current database using snapshot or transactional replication.  
  
3.  (Optional) At the Subscriber on the subscription database, execute [sp_subscription_cleanup](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-subscription-cleanup-transact-sql.md) to remove any remaining replication metadata in the subscription database.  
  
#### To delete a merge publication  
  
1.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   To delete a single publication, execute [sp_dropmergepublication &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-dropmergepublication-transact-sql.md) at the Publisher on the publication database.  
  
    -   To delete all publications in and remove all replication objects from a published database, execute [sp_removedbreplication](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-removedbreplication-transact-sql.md) at the Publisher. Specify a value of **merge** for **@type**. (Optional) If the Distributor cannot be accessed or if the status of the database is suspect or offline, specify a value of **1** for **@force**. (Optional) Specify the name of the database for **@dbname** if [sp_removedbreplication](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-removedbreplication-transact-sql.md) is not executed on the publication database.  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  Specifying a value of **1** for **@force** may leave replication-related publishing objects in the database.  
  
2.  (Optional) If this database has no other publications, execute [sp_replicationdboption &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-replicationdboption-transact-sql.md) to disable publication of the current database using merge replication.  
  
3.  (Optional) At the Subscriber on the subscription database, execute [sp_mergesubscription_cleanup &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-mergesubscription-cleanup-transact-sql.md) to remove any remaining replication metadata in the subscription database.  
  
###  <a name="TsqlExample"></a> Examples (Transact-SQL)  
 This example shows how to remove a transactional publication and disable transactional publishing for a database. This example assumes that all subscriptions were previously removed. For more information, see [Delete a Pull Subscription](../../../relational-databases/replication/delete-a-pull-subscription.md) or [Delete a Push Subscription](../../../relational-databases/replication/delete-a-push-subscription.md).  
  
 [!code-sql[HowTo#sp_droppublication](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/codesnippet/tsql/delete-a-publication_1.sql)]  
  
 This example shows how to remove a merge publication and disable merge publishing for a database. This example assumes that all subscriptions were previously removed. For more information, see [Delete a Pull Subscription](../../../relational-databases/replication/delete-a-pull-subscription.md) or [Delete a Push Subscription](../../../relational-databases/replication/delete-a-push-subscription.md).

##  <a name="RMOProcedure"></a> Using Replication Management Objects (RMO)  
 You can delete publications programmatically by using Replication Management Objects (RMO). The RMO classes that you use to remove a publication depend on the type of publication you remove.  
  
#### To remove a snapshot or transactional publication  
  
1.  Create a connection to the Publisher by using the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> class.  
  
2.  Create an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.TransPublication> class.  
  
3.  Set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Publication.Name%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Publication.DatabaseName%2A> properties for the publication, and set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.ConnectionContext%2A> property to the connection created in step 1.  
  
4.  Check the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.IsExistingObject%2A> property to verify that the publication exists. If the value of this property is **false**, either the publication properties in step 3 were defined incorrectly or the publication does not exist.  
  
5.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Publication.Remove%2A> method.  
  
6.  (Optional) If no other transactional publications exist for this database, the database can be disabled for transactional publishing as follows:  
  
    1.  Create an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationDatabase> class. Set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.ConnectionContext%2A> property to the instance of <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> from step 1.  
  
    2.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.LoadProperties%2A> method. If this method returns **false**, confirm that the database exists.  
  
    3.  Set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationDatabase.EnabledTransPublishing%2A> property to **false**.  
  
    4.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.CommitPropertyChanges%2A> method.  
  
7.  Close the connections.  
  
#### To remove a merge publication  
  
1.  Create a connection to the Publisher by using the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> class.  
  
2.  Create an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.MergePublication> class.  
  
3.  Set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Publication.Name%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Publication.DatabaseName%2A> properties for the publication, and set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.ConnectionContext%2A> property to the connection created in step 1.  
  
4.  Check the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.IsExistingObject%2A> property to verify that the publication exists. If the value of this property is **false**, either the publication properties in step 3 were defined incorrectly or the publication does not exist.  
  
5.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Publication.Remove%2A> method.  
  
6.  (Optional) If no other merge publications exist for this database, the database can be disabled for merge publishing as follows:  
  
    1.  Create an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationDatabase> class. Set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.ConnectionContext%2A> property to the instance of <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> from Step 1.  
  
    2.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.LoadProperties%2A> method. If this method returns **false**, verify that the database exists.  
  
    3.  Set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationDatabase.EnabledMergePublishing%2A> property to **false**.  
  
    4.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.CommitPropertyChanges%2A> method.  
  
7.  Close the connections.  
  
###  <a name="PShellExample"></a> Examples (RMO)  
 The following example deletes a transactional publication. If no other transactional publications exist for this database, transactional publishing is also disabled.
