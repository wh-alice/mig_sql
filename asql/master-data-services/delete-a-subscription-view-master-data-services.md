# Delete a Subscription View (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], delete a subscription view when it is no longer needed. Deleting a subscription view in [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../database-engine/install/windows/includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] removes the view from the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database. You can also edit a subscription view.

-   You must have permission to access the **Integration Management** functional area. For more information, see [Functional Area Permissions &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/functional-area-permissions-master-data-services.md).  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/administrators-master-data-services.md).
