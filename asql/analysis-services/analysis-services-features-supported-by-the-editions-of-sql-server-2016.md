##  <a name="BIC"></a> Business Intelligence Clients  
 The following software client applications are available on the Microsoft Download center and are provided to assist you with creating business intelligence documents that run on a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. When you host these documents in a server environment, use an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that supports that document type. The following table identifies which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition contains the server features required to host the documents created in these client applications.  
  
|Tool Name|Enterprise|Standard|Web|Express with Advanced Services|Express with Tools|Express|Developer|  
|---------------|----------------|--------------|---------|------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|  
|Data Mining Add-ins for Excel and Visio 2010 (.xlsx, .vsdx)|Yes|Yes|||||Yes|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssGeminiClient](../analysis-services/includes/ssgeminiclient-md.md)] 2010 and 2013 (.xlsx)|Yes||||||Yes|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)] (.xlsx)|Yes||||||Yes|  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  1.  [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiClient](../analysis-services/includes/ssgeminiclient-md.md)] is an Excel add-in for creating workbooks with a data model.  [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiClient](../analysis-services/includes/ssgeminiclient-md.md)] does not depend on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], but [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiShort](../analysis-services/includes/ssgeminishort-md.md)] is required for sharing and collaborating on Excel workbooks with a data model in SharePoint. This capability is available as part of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Enterprise edition.  
>   
>      In Excel 2016, Power Pivot capability is built in, so you no longer need the Power Pivot add-in.  
> 2.  The above table identifies the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] editions that are required to enable these client tools; however these tools can access data hosted on any edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
