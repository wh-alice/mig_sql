# Generating Reports (AccessToSQL)
The reports of certain activities performed using commands are generated in SSMA Console at object tree level.  
  
Use the following procedure to generate reports:  
  
1.  Specify the **write-summary-report-to** parameter. The related report is stored as the file name (if specified) or in the folder you specify. The file name is system-predefined as mentioned in the table below where, **&lt;n&gt;** is the unique file number that increments with a digit with each execution of the same command.  
  
    The reports vis-à-vis commands are:  
  
    ||||  
    |-|-|-|  
    |**Sl. No.**|**Command**|**Report Title**|  
    |1|generate-assessment-report|AssessmentReport&lt;n&gt;.XML|  
    |2|convert-schema|SchemaConversionReport&lt;n&gt;.XML|  
    |3|migrate-data|DataMigrationReport&lt;n&gt;.XML|  
    |4|synchronize-target|TargetSynchronizationReport&lt;n&gt;.XML|  
    |5|refresh-from-database|SourceDBRefreshReport&lt;n&gt;.XML|  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > An output report is different from Assessment Report. The former is a report on the performance of an executed command while, the latter is an XML report for programmatic consumption.  
  
    For the command options for output reports (from Sl. No. 2-4 above), refer to the [Executing the SSMA Console &#40;AccessToSQL&#41;](../../ssma/access/executing-the-ssma-console--accesstosql-.md) section.  
  
2.  Indicate the extent of detail you desire in the output report using the Report Verbosity settings:  
  
    ||||  
    |-|-|-|  
    |**Sl. No.**|**Command and Parameter**|**Output Description**|  
    |1|verbose=”false”|Generates a summarized report of the activity.|  
    |2|verbose=”true”|Generates a summarized and detailed status report for each activity.|  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > The Report Verbosity Settings specified above are applicable for generate-assessment-report, convert-schema, migrate-data commands.  
  
3.  Indicate the extent of detail you desire in the error reports using the Error Reporting settings:  
  
    ||||  
    |-|-|-|  
    |**Sl. No.**|**Command and Parameter**|**Output Description**|  
    |1|report-errors=”false”|No details on error/ warning/ info messages.|  
    |2|report-errors=”true”|Detailed error/ warning/ info messages.|  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > The Error Reporting Settings specified above are applicable for generate-assessment-report, convert-schema, migrate-data commands.  
  
**Example:**  
  
```xml  
<generate-assessment-report  
  
    object-name="testschema"  
  
    object-type="Schemas"  
  
    verbose="yes"  
  
    report-erors="yes"  
  
    write-summary-report-to="$AssessmentFolder$\Report1.xml"  
  
    assessment-report-folder="$AssessmentFolder$\assesment_report"  
  
    assessment-report-overwrite="true"  
  
/>  
```  
  
### synchronize-target:  
The command **synchronize-target** has **report-errors-to** parameter, which specifies the location of error report for the synchronization operation. Then, a file by name **TargetSynchronizationReport&lt;n&gt;.XML** is created at the specified location, where **&lt;n&gt;** is the unique file number that increments with a digit with each execution of the same command.  
  
**Note:** If the folder path is given, then ‘report-errors-to’ parameter becomes an optional attribute for the command ‘synchronize-target’.  
  
```xml  
<!-- Example: Synchronize target entire Database with all attributes-->  
  
<synchronize-target  
  
    object-name="$TargetDB$.dbo"  
  
    on-error="fail-script"  
  
    report-errors-to="$SynchronizationReports$"  
  
/>  
```  
**object-name:** Specifies the object(s) considered for synchronization (It can also have indivdual object names or a group object name).  
  
**on-error:** Specifies whether to specify synchronization errors as warnings or error. Available options for on-error:  
  
-   report-total-as-warning  
  
-   report-each-as-warning  
  
-   fail-script  
  
### refresh-from-database:  
The command **refresh-from-database** has **report-errors-to** parameter, which specifies the location of error report for the refresh operation. Then, a file by name **SourceDBRefreshReport&lt;n&gt;.XML** is created at the specified location, where **&lt;n&gt;** is the unique file number that increments with a digit with each execution of the same command.  
  
**Note:** If the folder path is given, then ‘report-errors-to’ parameter becomes an optional attribute for the command ‘synchronize-target’.  
  
```xml  
<!-- Example: Refresh entire Schema (with all attributes)-->  
  
<refresh-from-database  
  
    object-name="$SourceDatabaseStandard$"  
  
    object-type ="Databases"  
  
    on-error="fail-script"  
  
    report-errors-to="$RefreshDBFolder$\RefreshReport.xml"  
  
/>  
```  
**object-name:** Specifies the object(s) considered for refresh (It can also have indivdual object names or a group object name).  
  
**on-error:** Specifies whether to specify refresh errors as warnings or error. Available options for on-error:  
  
-   report-total-as-warning  
  
-   report-each-as-warning  
  
-   fail-script
