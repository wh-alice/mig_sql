# Flat File Connection Manager Editor (Columns Page)
  Use the **Columns** page of the **Flat File Connection Manager Editor** dialog box to specify the row and column information, and to preview the file.

 **Description**  
 Describe the connection. As a best practice, describe the connection in terms of its purpose, to make packages self-documenting and easier to maintain.
