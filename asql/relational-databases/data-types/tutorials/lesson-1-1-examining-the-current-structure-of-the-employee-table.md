# Lesson 1-1 - Examining the Current Structure of the Employee Table
The sample [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database contains an **Employee** table in the **HumanResources** schema. To avoid changing the original table, this step makes a copy of the **Employee** table named **EmployeeDemo**. To simplify the example, you only copy five columns from the original table. Then, you query the **HumanResources.EmployeeDemo** table to review how the data is structured in a table without using the **hierarchyid** data type.  
  
### To copy the Employee table  
  
1.  In a Query Editor window, run the following code to copy the table structure and data from the **Employee** table into a new table named **EmployeeDemo**.  
  
    ```  
    USE AdventureWorks ;  
    GO  
  
    SELECT EmployeeID, LoginID, ManagerID, Title, HireDate   
    INTO HumanResources.EmployeeDemo   
    FROM HumanResources.Employee ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
### To examine the structure and data of the EmployeeDemo table  
  
-   This new **EmployeeDemo** table represents a typical table in an existing database that you might want to migrate to a new structure. In a Query Editor window, run the following code to show how the table uses a self join to display the employee/manager relationships:  
  
    ```  
    SELECT   
         Mgr.EmployeeID AS MgrID, Mgr.LoginID AS Manager,   
         Emp.EmployeeID AS E_ID, Emp.LoginID, Emp.Title  
    FROM HumanResources.EmployeeDemo AS Emp  
    LEFT JOIN HumanResources.EmployeeDemo AS Mgr  
    ON Emp.ManagerID = Mgr.EmployeeID  
    ORDER BY MgrID, E_ID  
    ```  
  
    [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
    ```  
    MgrID Manager                 E_ID LoginID                  Title  
    NULL NULL                      109 adventure-works\ken0     Chief Executive Officer  
    3    adventure-works\roberto0  4   adventure-works\rob0     Senior Tool Designer  
    3    adventure-works\roberto0  9   adventure-works\gail0    Design Engineer  
    3    adventure-works\roberto0  11  adventure-works\jossef0  Design Engineer  
    3    adventure-works\roberto0  158 adventure-works\dylan0   Research and Development Manager  
    3    adventure-works\roberto0  263 adventure-works\ovidiu0  Senior Tool Designer  
    3    adventure-works\roberto0  267 adventure-works\michael8 Senior Design Engineer  
    3    adventure-works\roberto0  270 adventure-works\sharon0  Design Engineer  
    6    adventure-works\david0    2   adventure-works\kevin0   Marketing Assistant  
    ...  
    ```  
  
    The results continue for a total of 290 rows.  
  
Notice that the **ORDER BY** clause caused the output to list the direct reports of each management level together. For instance, all seven of the direct reports of **MgrID** 3 (roberto0) are listed adjacent to each other. Although not impossible, it is much more difficult to group all those who eventually report to **MgrID** 3.  
  
In the next task, we will create a new table with a **hierarchyid** data type, and move the data into the new table.
