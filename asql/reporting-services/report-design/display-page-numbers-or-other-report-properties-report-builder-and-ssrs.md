# Display Page Numbers or Other Report Properties (Report Builder and SSRS)
  It's easy to add page numbers, a report title, file name, and other report properties to the page headers or footers of your report. These properties are stored as fields in the Built-in Fields folder in the Report Data pane:  
  
-   Execution time  
  
-   Page number  
  
-   Report folder  
  
-   Report name  
  
-   Report server URL  
  
-   Total pages  
  
-   User ID  
  
-   Language  
  
 For a page number, you may want to add the word "Page" before the number. You may also want to show the total number of pages.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Adding the total number of pages to the footer may slow performance when you run or preview your report.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../a9retired/includes/ssrbrddup-md.md)]  
  
### To add a page number or other report properties  
  
1.  In the Report Data pane, expand the Built-in Fields folder.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you don't see the Report Data pane, on the View tab, check **Report Data**.  
  
2.  Drag the **Page Number** field from the Report Data pane to the report header or footer.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The page footer is added to the report automatically. To add a page header, on the **Insert** tab, click **Header**, and then click **Add Header**.  
    >   
    >  A text box that contains the simple expression [&PageNumber] is added.  
  
### To add the word "Page" before the page number  
  
1.  Right-click the text box that contains [&PageNumber] and click **Expressions**.  
  
     The **Set Expression for: Value** text box contains the expression =Globals!PageNumber.  
  
2.  Place the cursor after the = sign and type **"Page " &**.  
  
     The expression is now  ="Page "&Globals!PageNumber  
  
3.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../a9notintoc/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
### To add total number of pages after the page number  
  
1.  Right click the text box with the expression and click **Expressions**.  
  
2.  Type **&" of "&** at the end of the expression.  
  
3.  In the Category pane, expand **Built-in Fields** and double-click **TotalPages**.  
  
     The expression is now ="Page "&Globals!PageNumber &" of "&Globals!TotalPages  
  
4.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../a9notintoc/includes/clickok-md.md)]
