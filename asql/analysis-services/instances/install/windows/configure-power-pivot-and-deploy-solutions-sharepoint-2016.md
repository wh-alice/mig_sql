-   For information on backend services and installing a [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] server in [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] mode, see [Install Analysis Services in Power Pivot Mode](../../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/install-analysis-services-in-power-pivot-mode.md).

##  <a name="bkmk_run_configuration_tool"></a> Run Power Pivot for SharePoint 2016 configuration  
 **Note:** To complete the following steps, you must be a farm administrator. If you see an error message similar to the following:  
  
-   “The user is not a farm administrator. Please address the validation failures and try again.”  
  
 Either login as the account that installed SharePoint or configure the setup account as the primary administrator of the SharePoint Central Administration Site.  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, select **All Programs**, and then select [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrentui-md.md)], select **Configuration Tools**, and then select **[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] For SharePoint 2016 Configuration**. Tools is listed only when [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint is installed on the local server.  
  
2.  Select **Configure or Repair [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint** and then select **OK**.  
  
3.  The tool runs validation to verify the current state of [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] and what steps are required to complete configuration. Expand the window to full size. You should see a button bar at the bottom of the window that includes **Validate**, **Run**, and **Exit** commands.  
  
4.  On the **Parameters** tab:  
  
    1.  **Default Account UserName**: Enter a domain user account for the default account. This account will be used to provision services, including the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] service application pool. Do not specify a built-in account such as Network Service or Local System. The tool blocks configurations that specify built-in accounts.  
  
    2.  **Database Server**: You can use SQL Server Database engine that is supported for the SharePoint farm.  
  
    3.  **Passphrase**: Enter a passphrase. If you are creating a new SharePoint farm, the passphrase is used whenever you add a server or application to the SharePoint farm. If the farm already exists, enter the passphrase that allows you to add a server application to the farm.  
  
    4.  Click **Create Site Collection** in the left window. Note **Site URL** so you can reference it in later steps. If the SharePoint server is not already configured, then the configuration wizard defaults the web application, and site collection URLs to the root of `http://[ServerName]`. To modify the defaults review the following pages in the left window: **Create Default Web application** and **Deploy Web Application Solution**  
  
5.  Optionally, review the remaining input values used to complete each action. Click each action in the left window to see and review the details of the action. For more information about each one, see the section “Input values used to configure the server in [Configure or Repair Power Pivot for SharePoint 2010 (Power Pivot Configuration Tool)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d61f49c5-efaa-4455-98f2-8c293fa50046) in this topic.  
  
6.  Optionally, remove any actions that you do not want to process at this time. For example, if you want to configure Secure Store Service later, select **Configure Secure Store Service**, and then clear the checkbox **Include this action in the task list**.  
  
7.  select **Validate** to check whether the tool has sufficient information to process the actions in the list. If you see validation errors, click the warnings in the left pane to see details of the validation error. Correct any validation errors and then select **Validate** again.  
  
8.  Select **Run** to process all of the actions in the task list. Note that **Run** becomes available after you validate the actions. If **Run** is not enabled, select **Validate** first.

##  <a name="bkmk_verify_powerpivot"></a> Verify Power Pivot Configuration  
 **Services:**  
  
1.  In Central Administration, in System Settings, select **Manage services on server**.  
  
2.  Verify that **SQL Server [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service** is started.  
  
 **Farm Feature:**  
  
1.  In Central Administration, in System Settings, select **Manage farm features**.  
  
2.  Verify that **[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Integration Feature** is **Active**.  
  
 **Site Collection Feature:**  
  
1.  Browse to your site URL that was created by the Configuration tool.  
  
     Select **Settings**![SharePoint Settings](../../../../a9retired/media/as-sharepoint2013-settings-gear.gif "SharePoint Settings"), and then click **Site Settings**.  
  
     Select **Site Collection Features**.  
  
2.  Verify that **[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Feature Integration for Site Collections** is **Active**.  
  
 **[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Service Application:**  
  
1.  In Central Administration, in the **Application Management**, select **Manage service applications**.  
  
2.  Verify the service application status is **started**. The default name is **Default [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Service Application**.  
  
     Select the name of the services application to open the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Management Dashboard for the service application opens. On first use, the dashboard takes several minutes to load.

##  <a name="bkmk_troubleshoot_issues"></a> Troubleshoot Issues  
 To assist in troubleshooting issues, it is a good idea to verify the diagnostic logging is enabled.

4.  Verify **Enable health data collection** is selected.  
  
5.  Select **OK**.
