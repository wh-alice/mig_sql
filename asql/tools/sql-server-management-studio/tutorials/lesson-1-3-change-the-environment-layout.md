# Lesson 1-3 - Change the Environment Layout
The components of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] compete for screen space. To make more room, you can close, hide, or move [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] components. The practices on this page move the components to different locations.  
  
## Closing and Hiding Components  
  
#### To practice closing, hiding, and reopening component windows  
  
1.  Hide Registered Servers by clicking the **x** in the upper right corner of Registered Servers. Registered Servers closes.  
  
2.  In Object Explorer, click the push-pin button with the **Auto Hide** ToolTip. Object Explorer is minimized to the left side of the screen.  
  
3.  Move your mouse over the Object Explorer title bar. It reopens.  
  
4.  Click the push-pin again to pin Object Explorer in the open position.  
  
5.  On the **View** menu, click **Registered Servers** to restore Registered Servers.  
  
## Moving Components  
The environment that hosts [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] allows you to move components and dock them in a variety of configurations.  
  
#### To practice moving components  
  
1.  Click and drag the title bar of Registered Servers into the middle of the document window. The component undocks and remains floating until you drop it.  
  
2.  Drag Registered Servers around to different locations on the screen. In several areas of the screen, you receive blue docking information. The arrows indicate that dropping the component in that location causes the window to dock to the top, bottom, or side of the frame. Moving the component into the arrow causes the underlying screen to darken in the target location. The center circle indicates that the component shares the space with other components. When dropped in the center, the available components appear as tabs within the frame.  
  
## Undocking Components  
You can customize the presentation of the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] components.  
  
#### To dock and undock components  
  
1.  Right-click the title bar of Object Explorer and note the following menu options:  
  
    -   Float  
  
    -   Dock  
  
    -   Dock as Tabbed Document  
  
    -   Auto Hide  
  
    -   Hide  
  
    These options are also available from the **Window** menu, or from the down arrow on the toolbar.  
  
2.  Double-click the title bar of Object Explorer to undock it.  
  
3.  CTRL + double-click the title bar again to dock Object Explorer.  
  
4.  Click and drag the title bar of Object Explorer to the right border of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. As you drag Object Explorer, guide diamonds are displayed that indicate where you can dock the window. Drag Object Explorer over a guide diamond to see how the window would be positioned. Drop Object Explorer on the guide diamond to the far right of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. When dragging a tool window, the cursor must be positioned over a guide diamond to either see the docking effect or to doc the window.  
  
5.  Object Explorer can also be moved to the top or bottom of Management Studio. Drag and drop Object Explorer back to the guide diamond in the original position of the window on the left side.  
  
6.  Right-click the title bar of Object Explorer, and then click **Hide**.  
  
7.  On the **View** menu, click **Object Explorer** to restore the window.  
  
8.  Right-click the title bar of Object Explorer, and then click **Float** to undock Object Explorer.  
  
9. To restore the default configuration, on the **Window** menu, click **Reset Window Layout**.
