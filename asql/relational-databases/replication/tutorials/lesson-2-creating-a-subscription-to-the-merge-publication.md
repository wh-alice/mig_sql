# Lesson 2: Creating a Subscription to the Merge Publication
In this lesson, you will create the subscription using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. You will then set permissions on the subscription database and manually generate the filtered data snapshot for the new subscription. This lesson requires that you have completed the previous lesson, [Lesson 1: Publishing Data Using Merge Replication](../../../relational-databases/replication/tutorials/lesson-1-publishing-data-using-merge-replication.md).  
  
### To create the subscription  
  
1.  Connect to the Subscriber in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], expand the server node, expand the **Replication** folder, right-click the **Local Subscriptions** folder, and then click **New Subscriptions**.  
  
    The New Subscription Wizard launches.  
  
2.  On the **Publication** page, click **Find SQL Server Publisher** in the **Publisher** list.  
  
3.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, enter the name of the Publisher instance in the **Server name** box, and click **Connect**.  
  
4.  Click **AdvWorksSalesOrdersMerge**, and click **Next**.  
  
5.  On the Merge Agent Location page, click **Run each agent at its Subscriber**, and then click **Next**.  
  
6.  On the Subscribers page, select the instance name of the Subscriber server, and under **Subscription Database**, select **<New Database>** from the list.  
  
7.  In the **New Database** dialog box, enter **SalesOrdersReplica** in the **Database name** box, click **OK**, and then click **Next**.  
  
8.  On the Merge Agent Security page, click the ellipsis (**…**) button, enter \<*Machine_Name>***\repl_merge** in the **Process account** box, supply the password for this account, click **OK**, click **Next**, and then click **Next** again.  
  
9. On the Initialize Subscriptions page, select **At first synchronization** from the **Initialize When** list, click **Next**, and then click **Next** again.  
  
10. On the HOST_NAME Values page, enter a value of **adventure-works\pamela0** in the **HOST_NAME Value** box, and then click **Finish**.  
  
11. Click **Finish** again, and after the subscription is created, click **Close**.  
  
### Setting database permissions at the Subscriber  
  
1.  Connect to the Subscriber in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], expand **Databases**, **SalesOrdersReplica**, and **Security**, right-click **Users**, and then select **New User**.  
  
2.  On the **General** page, enter \<*Machine_Name>***\repl_merge** in the **User name** box, click the ellipsis (**…**) button, click **Browse**, select \<*Machine_Name>***\repl_merge**, click **OK**, click **Check Names**, and then click **OK**.  
  
3.  In **Database role membership**, select **db_owner**, and then click **OK** to create the user.  
  
### To create the filtered data snapshot for the subscription  
  
1.  Connect to the Publisher in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], expand the server node, and then expand the **Replication** folder.  
  
2.  In the **Local Publications** folder, right-click the **AdvWorksSalesOrdersMerge** publication, and then click **Properties**.  
  
    The **Publication Properties** dialog box is displayed.  
  
3.  Select the **Data Partitions** page, and click **Add**.  
  
4.  In the **Add Data Partition** dialog box, type **adventure-works\pamela0** in the **HOST_NAME Value** box, and then click **OK**.  
  
5.  Select the newly added partition, click **Generate the selected snapshots now**, and then click **OK**.  
  
## Next Steps  
You have successfully created a subscription to the merge publication and generated the filtered snapshot for the new subscription's data partition so that it will be available when the subscription is initialized. Next, you will grant rights to the Merge Agent on the subscription database and run the Merge Agent to start synchronization and initialize the subscription. See [Lesson 3: Synchronizing the Subscription to the Merge Publication](../../../relational-databases/replication/tutorials/lesson-3-synchronizing-the-subscription-to-the-merge-publication.md).
