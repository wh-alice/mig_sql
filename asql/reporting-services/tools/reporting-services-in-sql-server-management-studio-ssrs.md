# Reporting Services in SQL Server Management Studio (SSRS)
  Report server administrators can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to:  
  
-   Enable features, set server defaults, and manage running jobs.  
  
-   View and create custom reports. In Object Explorer, many nodes display a set of standard reports that are installed with [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. You must have administrator permissions. The schema of a custom report must match the schema of the installed reports. For more information, see [Custom Reports in Management Studio](../Topic/Custom%20Reports%20in%20Management%20Studio.md) and [Find the Report Definition Schema Version &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/reports/find-the-report-definition-schema-version-ssrs.md).  
  
 Report authors can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] to:  
  
-   Visualize spatial data from a query result set for a map report. After you run the query, use the **Spatial results** tab in the result set pane. For more information, see [View Spatial Data in Object Explorer](../../relational-databases/scripting/view-spatial-data-in-object-explorer.md).  
  
 This section contains step-by-step instructions for performing various reporting tasks using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. Creating and managing shared schedules can also be performed using Report Manager.
