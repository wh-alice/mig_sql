# Lesson 1-2 - Query and Modify the SQL Server Data
Now that you've loaded the data into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can use the data sources you created  as arguments to R functions in [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../../a9notintoc/includes/rsql-productname-md.md)], to get basic information about the variables, and generate summaries and histograms.  
  
In this step, you'll re-use the data sources to do some quick analysis and then enhance the data:  
  
## Query the Data  
First, get a list of the columns and their data types.  
  
1.  Use the function *rxGetVarInfo* and specify the data source you want to analyze:  
  
    ```R  
    rxGetVarInfo(data = sqlFraudDS)   
    ```  
  
  
**Results**  
*Var 1: custID, Type: integer*  
*Var 2: gender, Type: integer*  
*Var 3: state, Type: integer*  
*Var 4: cardholder, Type: integer*  
*Var 5: balance, Type: integer*  
*Var 6: numTrans, Type: integer*  
*Var 7: numIntlTrans, Type: integer*  
*Var 8: creditLine, Type: integer*  
*Var 9: fraudRisk, Type: integer*  
  
## Modify Metadata  
All the variables are stored as integers, but some variables represent categorical data,called *factor variables* in R. For example, the column *state* contains numbers used as identifiers for the 50 states plus the District of Columbia.  To make it easier to understand the data, you replace the numbers with a list of state abbreviations.  
  
In this step, you will provide a string vector containing the abbreviations, and then map these categorical values to the original integer identifiers. After this varaible is ready, you'll use it in the *colInfo* argument, to specify that this column be handled as a factor. Thereafter, the abbreviations will be used and the column handled as a factor whenever this data is analyzed or imported.  
  
1.  Begin by creating an R variable, *stateAbb*, and defining the vector of strings to add to it, as follows:  
  
    ```R  
    stateAbb <- c("AK", "AL", "AR", "AZ", "CA", "CO", "CT", "DC",     
        "DE", "FL", "GA", "HI","IA", "ID", "IL", "IN", "KS", "KY", "LA",   
        "MA", "MD", "ME", "MI", "MN", "MO", "MS", "MT", "NB", "NC", "ND",   
        "NH", "NJ", "NM", "NV", "NY", "OH", "OK", "OR", "PA", "RI","SC",   
        "SD", "TN", "TX", "UT", "VA", "VT", "WA", "WI", "WV", "WY")  
  
    ```  
  
2.  Next, create a column information object, named *ccColInfo*, that specifies the mapping of the existing integer values to the categorical levels (the abbreviations for states).  
  
    This statement also creates factor variables for gender and cardholder.  
  
    ```R  
    ccColInfo <- list(
    gender = list(
              type = "factor",
              levels = c("1", "2"), 
              newLevels = c("Male", "Female")
              ),
    cardholder = list(
                  type = "factor",
                  levels = c("1", "2"),
                  newLevels = c("Principal", "Secondary")
                   ),
    state = list(
             type = "factor",
             levels = as.character(1:51), 
             newLevels = stateAbb
             ),
    balance = list(type = "numeric")
    )  

    ```  
  
3.  To create the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data source that uses the updated data, call the *RxSqlServerData* function as before but add the *colInfo* argument.  
  
    ```R  
    sqlFraudDS <- RxSqlServerData(connectionString = sqlConnString,  
    table = sqlFraudTable, colInfo = ccColInfo,  
    rowsPerRead = sqlRowsPerRead)   
    ```  
  
    -   For the *table* parameter, pass in the variable *sqlFraudTable*, which contains the data source you created earlier.    
    -   For the *colInfo* parameter, pass in the *ccColInfo* variable, which contains the column data types and factor levels.
    -   Mapping the column to abbreviations before using it as a factor actually improves performance as well. For more information, see [R and Data Optimization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt723575.aspx)  
  
4.  You can now use the function *rxGetVarInfo* to view the variables in the new data source.  
  
    ```R  
    rxGetVarInfo(data = sqlFraudDS)   
    ```  
  
**Results**  
  
*Var 1: custID, Type: integer*  
*Var 2: gender       2 factor levels: Male Female*  
*Var 3: state       51 factor levels: AK AL AR AZ CA ... VT WA WI WV WY*  
*Var 4: cardholder       2 factor levels: Principal Secondary*  
*Var 5: balance, Type: integer*  
*Var 6: numTrans, Type: integer*  
*Var 7: numIntlTrans, Type: integer*  
*Var 8: creditLine, Type: integer*  
*Var 9: fraudRisk, Type: integer*  
  
Now the three variables you specified (_gender_, _state_, and _cardholder_) are  treated as factors.
