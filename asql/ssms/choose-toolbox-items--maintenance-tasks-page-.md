# Choose Toolbox Items (Maintenance Tasks Page)
This tab of the **Customize Toolbox** dialog box displays a list of all maintenancetask components registered on your computer and makes it possible for you to change the ones that are displayed in the Toolbox. You can open the **Customize Toolbox** dialog box from the **Tools** menu. To sort the list of components, select any column heading.  
  
## Options  
The **Maintenance Tasks** tab includes the following columns of information.  
  
**Name**  
Displays the names of available components. Preceding each name is a check box. If selected, a check box indicates that SQL Server Management Studio has found an entry for the component in your computer's registry. The component is either already displayed on the active **Toolbox** tab, or it will be added to it when you click **OK**. If cleared, a check box indicates that the component is not currently displayed in the **Toolbox**, or that it will be removed from the **Toolbox** when you click **OK**.  
  
**Path**  
Displays the full path to the component. To identify the default components that shipped with the product, sort on this column and then locate those stored on the Microsoft Visual Studio installation path.  
  
**Last Modified**  
Displays the date when the component was last modified.  
  
Click on a name to show the attributes of the component in the **Language** and **Version** boxes, along with the icon.  
  
## Options  
**Language**  
The language of the component.  
  
**Version**  
The version of the component.
