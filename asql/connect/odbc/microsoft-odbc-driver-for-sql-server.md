# Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../connect/odbc/linux/includes)]

ODBC is the primary native data access API for applications written in C and C++ for SQL Server, and there is an ODBC driver for most data sources. Other languages, including COBOL, Perl, PHP, and Python, use ODBC and it is widely used in data integration scenarios. The ODBC driver comes with tools such as  [sqlcmd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms162773.aspx) and  [bcp](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms162802.aspx). The sqlcmd utility lets you run Transact-SQL statements, system procedures, and SQL scripts. The bcp utility bulk copies data between an instance of Microsoft SQL Server and a data file in a format you choose. You can use bcp to import many new rows into SQL Server tables or to export data out of tables into data files.
