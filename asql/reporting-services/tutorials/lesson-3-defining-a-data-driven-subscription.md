# Lesson 3: Defining a Data-Driven Subscription
In this [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] tutorial lesson, you use the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] web portals data-driven subscription pages to connect to a subscription data source, build a query that retrieves subscription data, and map the result set to report and delivery options.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Before you start, verify that **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent** service is running. If it is not running, you cannot save the subscription.  One method for verification is to open the [SQL Server Configuraton Manger](../../relational-databases/sql-server-configuration-manager.md).
This lesson assumes you completed Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 and that the report data source uses stored credentials.  For more information, see [Lesson 2: Modifying the Report Data Source Properties](../../reporting-services/tutorials/lesson-2-modifying-the-report-data-source-properties.md)  
  
## <a name="bkmk_startwizard"></a>Start the Data-Driven Subscription Wizard  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] web portal, click **Home**, and navigate to the folder containing the **Sales Orders** report.  
  
2.  In the context menu ![ssrs_tutorial_datadriven_reportmenu](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/ssrs-tutorial-datadriven-reportmenu.png) of the report, click **Manage**, and then click **Subscriptions** in the left pane.  
  
3.  Click **+ New Subscription**. If you do not see this button, you do not have Content Manager permissions. 
  
## Define a description  
1.  Type **Sales Order delivery** in description.
## Type
1.  click **Data-driven subscription**..  
## Schedule
1. In the schedule section click **Report-specific schedule**.
2. Click **Edit schedule**.
3.  In **Schedule Details**, click **Once**.  
4.  Specify a start time that is a few minutes ahead of the current time.  
5.  Click **Apply**.
## Destination  
1.  In the Destination section, Select **Windows File Share** for the method of delivery.  

## Dataset
1. click **Edit Dataset**.
2. Select **A custom data source**.
3. Select **Microsoft SQL Server** as the data source **Connection** type.
4. In Connection string, type the following connection string. *Subscribers* is the database you created in lesson 1. 
  
    ```  
    data source=localhost; initial catalog=Subscribers
    ```
    
 ## Credentials
 1. Select **Using the following credentials**.
 2. Select **Windows user name and password**.
 3.  In **User Name** and **Password**, type your domain user name and password. Include both the domain and user account when specifying **User Name**.
     > [!NOTE]  
    > Credentials used to connect to a subscriber data source are not passed back to [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. If you modify the subscription later, you must retype the password used to connect to the data source.
## Query      
1.  In the query box, type the following query:  
  
    ```  
    Select * from OrderInfo  
    ```  
  
2.  Specify a time-out of 30 seconds.  
  
3.  Click **Validate query**, and then click **Apply**.
## Delivery Options
Fill in the following values:

Parameter  |Source of value  | Value/field  
---------|---------|---------
**File name**     |Get value from dataset | Order     
**Path**     | Enter value  | In the Value, type the name of a public file share for which you have write permissions (for example, `\\mycomputer\public\myreports`). 
**Render Format** | Get value from dataset | Format
**Write mode**| Enter Value| Autoincrement    
**File Extension** |Enter Value |True
**User Name** | Enter Value | Type your domain user account. Enter it in this format: \<domain>\\\<account>. The user account needs to have permissions to the path you configured. 
**Password** | Enter Value | Type your password

## Report parameters
 1. In the **OrderNumber** field , select **Get value from dataset**. In Value, select **Order**. 
 2. Click **Create Subscription**.
   
## Next Steps  
When the subscription runs, four report files will be delivered to the file share you specified, one for each order in the *Subscribers* data source. Each delivery should be unique in terms of data (the data should be order-specific), rendering format, and file format. You can open each report from the shared folder to verify that each version is customized based on the subscription options you defined.  
  
![List of files created by the subscription](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/ssrs-tutorial-datadriven-subscription-filelist.gif "List of files created by the subscription")  
  
The subscription page in the Web portal will contain the **Last Run** date and **Status** of the subscription. 
**Note:** Refresh the page after the subscription runs to see the updated information.
