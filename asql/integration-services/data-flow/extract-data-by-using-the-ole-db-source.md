# Extract Data by Using the OLE DB Source
  To add and configure an OLE DB source, the package must already include at least one Data Flow task.  
  
### To extract data using an OLE DB Source  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  Click the **Data Flow** tab, and then, from the **Toolbox**, drag the OLE DB source to the design surface.  
  
4.  Double-click the OLE DB source.  
  
5.  In the **OLE DB Source Editor** dialog box, on the **Connection Manager** page, select an existing OLE DB connection manager or click **New** to create a new connection manager. For more information, see [OLE DB Connection Manager](../../integration-services/connection-manager/ole-db-connection-manager.md).  
  
6.  Select the data access method:  
  
    -   **Table or view** Select a table or view in the database to which the OLE DB connection manager connects.  
  
    -   **Table name or view name variable** Select the user-defined variable that contains the name of a table or view in the database to which the OLE DB connection manager connects.  
  
    -   **SQL command** Type an SQL command or click **Build Query** to write an SQL command using the **Query Builder**.  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  The command can include parameters. For more information, see [Map Query Parameters to Variables in a Data Flow Component](../../integration-services/data-flow/map-query-parameters-to-variables-in-a-data-flow-component.md).  
  
    -   **SQL command from variable** Select the user-defined variable that contains the SQL command.  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  The variables must be defined in the scope of the same Data Flow task that contains the OLE DB source, or in the scope of the same package; additionally, the variable must have a string data type.  
  
7.  To update the mapping between external and output columns, click **Columns** and select different columns in the **External Column** list.  
  
8.  Optionally, update the names of output columns by editing values in the **Output Column** list.  
  
9. To configure the error output, click **Error Output**. For more information, see [Configure an Error Output in a Data Flow Component](../../integration-services/troubleshooting/configure-an-error-output-in-a-data-flow-component.md).  
  
10. You can click **Preview** to view up to 200 rows of the data extracted by the OLE DB source.  
  
11. Click **OK**.  
  
12. To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.
