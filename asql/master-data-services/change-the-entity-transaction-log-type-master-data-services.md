|Attribute|Entity change logs are saved at the attribute level.<br /><br /> The transaction log is saved, as it is for [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)].|  
|Member|Entity change logs as saved at the row level.<br /><br /> Any attribute change triggers a new row revision.<br /><br /> When using row transaction log type, the entity is stored as a slowly changing dimension Type 4.
