# Lesson 1-3 - Optimizing the NewOrg Table
The **NewOrd** table that you created in the [Populating a Table with Existing Hierarchical Data](../../../relational-databases/data-types/tutorials/lesson-1-2-populating-a-table-with-existing-hierarchical-data.md) task contains all the employee information, and represents the hierarchical structure by using a **hierarchyid** data type. This task adds new indexes to support searches on the **hierarchyid** column.  
  
## Clustered Index  
The **hierarchyid** column (**OrgNode**) is the primary key for the **NewOrg** table. When the table was created, it contained a clustered index named **PK_NewOrg_OrgNode** to enforce the uniqueness of the **OrgNode** column. This clustered index also supports a depth-first search of the table.  
  
## Nonclustered Index  
This step creates two nonclustered indexes to support typical searches.  
  
#### To index the NewOrg table for efficient searches  
  
1.  To help queries at the same level in the hierarchy, use the [GetLevel](../../../t-sql/data-types/getlevel-database-engine.md) method to create a computed column that contains the level in the hierarchy. Then, create a composite index on the level and the **Hierarchyid**. Run the following code to create the computed column and the breadth-first index:  
  
    ```  
    ALTER TABLE NewOrg   
       ADD H_Level AS OrgNode.GetLevel() ;  
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX EmpBFInd   
       ON NewOrg(H_Level, OrgNode) ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
2.  Create a unique index on the **EmployeeID** column. This is the traditional singleton lookup of a single employee by **EmployeeID** number. Run the following code to create an index on **EmployeeID**:  
  
    ```  
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX EmpIDs_unq ON NewOrg(EmployeeID) ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
3.  Run the following code to retrieve data from the table in the order of each of the three indexes:  
  
    ```  
    SELECT OrgNode.ToString() AS LogicalNode,  
    OrgNode, H_Level, EmployeeID, LoginID  
    FROM NewOrg   
    ORDER BY OrgNode;  
  
    SELECT OrgNode.ToString() AS LogicalNode,  
    OrgNode, H_Level, EmployeeID, LoginID   
    FROM NewOrg   
    ORDER BY H_Level, OrgNode;  
  
    SELECT OrgNode.ToString() AS LogicalNode,  
    OrgNode, H_Level, EmployeeID, LoginID   
    FROM NewOrg   
    ORDER BY EmployeeID;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
4.  Compare the result sets to see how the order is stored in each type of index. Only the first four rows of each output follow.  
  
    [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
    Depth-first index: Employee records are stored adjacent to their manager.  
  
    `LogicalNode OrgNode    H_Level EmployeeID LoginID`  
  
    `/             0x         0         1      zarifin`  
  
    `/1/          0x58        1         2      tplate`  
  
    `/1/1/       0x5AC0       2         4      schai`  
  
    `/1/1/1/     0x5AD6       3         9      jwang`  
  
    `/1/1/2/     0x5ADA       3        10      malexander`  
  
    `/1/2/       0x5B40       2         5      elang`  
  
    `/1/3/       0x5BC0       2         6      gsmits`  
  
    `/2/         0x68         1         3      hjensen`  
  
    `/2/1/       0x6AC0       2         7      sdavis`  
  
    `/2/2/       0x6B40       2         8      norint`  
  
    **EmployeeID**-first index: Rows are stored in **EmployeeID** sequence.  
  
    `LogicalNode OrgNode    H_Level EmployeeID LoginID`  
  
    `/             0x         0         1      zarifin`  
  
    `/1/          0x58        1         2      tplate`  
  
    `/2/         0x68         1         3      hjensen`  
  
    `/1/1/       0x5AC0       2         4      schai`  
  
    `/1/2/       0x5B40       2         5      elang`  
  
    `/1/3/       0x5BC0       2         6      gsmits`  
  
    `/2/1/       0x6AC0       2         7      sdavis`  
  
    `/2/2/       0x6B40       2         8      norint`  
  
    `/1/1/1/     0x5AD6       3         9      jwang`  
  
    `/1/1/2/     0x5ADA       3        10      malexander`

#### To drop the unnecessary columns  
  
1.  The **ManagerID** column represents the employee/manager relationship, which is now represented by the **OrgNode** column. If other applications do not need the **ManagerID** column, consider dropping it by using the following statement:  
  
    ```  
    ALTER TABLE NewOrg DROP COLUMN ManagerID ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
2.  The **EmployeeID** column is also redundant. The **OrgNode** column uniquely identifies each employee. If other applications do not need the **EmployeeID** column, consider dropping the index and then the column by using the following code:  
  
    ```  
    DROP INDEX EmpIDs_unq ON NewOrg ;  
    ALTER TABLE NewOrg DROP COLUMN EmployeeID ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
#### To replace the original table with the new table  
  
1.  If your original table contained any additional indexes or constraints, add them to the **NewOrg** table.  
  
2.  Replace the old **EmployeeDemo** table with the new table. Run the following code to drop the old table, and then rename the new table with the old name:  
  
    ```  
    DROP TABLE EmployeeDemo ;  
    GO  
    sp_rename 'NewOrg', EmployeeDemo ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
3.  Run the following code to examine the final table:  
  
    ```  
    SELECT * FROM EmployeeDemo ;  
    ```
