# Power Pivot Authentication and Authorization
  A [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint deployment that runs within a SharePoint 2010 farm uses the authentication subsystem and authorization model provided by SharePoint servers. SharePoint security infrastructure extends to [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] content and operations because all [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)]-related content is stored in SharePoint content databases and all [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)]-related operations are performed by [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] shared services in the farm. Users who request a workbook that contains [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data are authenticated using a SharePoint user identity that is based on their Windows user identity. View permissions on the workbook determine whether the request is granted or denied.  
  
 Because integration with Excel Services is required for self-service data analytics, securing a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] server requires that you also understand Excel Services security. When a user queries a PivotTable that has a data connection to [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data, Excel Services forwards a data connection request to a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] server in the farm to load the data. This interaction between the servers requires that you understand how to configure security settings for both servers.

##  <a name="bkmk_auth"></a> Windows Authentication Using Classic Mode Sign-in Requirement  
 [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint supports a reduced set of the authentication options that are available in SharePoint. Of the available authentication options, only Windows authentication is supported for a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint deployment. In addition, the web application through which sign-in occurs must be configured for classic mode.  
  
 Windows authentication is required because the Analysis Services data engine in a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint deployment supports only Windows authentication. Excel Services establishes connections to Analysis Services via the MSOLAP OLE DB provider using a Windows user identity that was authenticated via NTLM or the Kerberos protocol.  
  
 The second requirement, classic mode authentication on the web application, is required to ensure the operability of the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] web service. The web service is a component that runs on a Web front-end and provides HTTP redirection to a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint server in the farm. While the web service is claims aware for service-to-service communications, it is not claims aware for the data connection requests that it routes to a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] shared service in the farm. Requests to load [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data are only supported for authenticated connections that come from IIS using a Windows identity. Classic mode sign-in on the web application is what enables a successful connection from the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] web service to [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] shared services in the farm.  
  
 Although classic mode sign-in is not required for the more common data access scenario (where [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data is extracted from the same Excel workbook that renders it) do not attempt to use [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint with SharePoint web applications that are configured to use other authentication providers. Doing so will result in a connection failure whenever users try to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks as an external data source.  
  
 Without classic mode sign-in, the following types of requests that are handled by [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Web service will fail:  
  
-   Any request for [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data that originates from outside the farm (for example, creating a report in Report Designer or Report Builder, where the data source is a SharePoint URL to a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbook)  
  
-   In-farm requests from a client application or report that uses the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbook as an external data source (for example, creating a workbook in the Excel desktop application, using as your data source a second published Excel workbook containing [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data)  
  
### How to check the authentication provider for your application  
 When creating new web applications, be sure to select the **Classic mode authentication** option in the Create New Web Application page.  
  
 For existing web applications, use the following instructions to verify the web application is configured to use Windows authentication.  
  
1.  In Central Administration, in Application Management, click **Manage web applications**.  
  
2.  Select the web application.  
  
3.  Click **Authentication Providers**.  
  
4.  Verify that you have one provider for each zone, and the Default zone is set to Windows.  
  
##  <a name="UserConnections"></a> Power Pivot Operations Requiring User Authorization  
 SharePoint authorization is used exclusively for all levels of access to [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] query and data processing.  
  
 The Analysis Services role-based authorization model is not supported. There is no role-based authorization for [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data at the cell, row, or table level. You cannot secure different parts of the workbook to grant or deny access to sensitive data within it for specific users. Embedded [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data is wholly available to users who have View permissions on the Excel workbook in a SharePoint library.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint will impersonate a SharePoint user in the following cases:  
  
-   Queries to PivotTables or PivotCharts that have data connections to a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] database, where a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] service application establishes connections on behalf of a user to a specific [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] shared service instance that processes the data.  
  
-   Loading [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data from cache or a library if the data is not otherwise available. If a data connection request is made for [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data that is not already loaded in the system, the [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiSrv](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssgeminisrv-md.md)] instance will use the identity of the SharePoint user to retrieve the data source from a content library and load it into memory.  
  
-   Data refresh operations that save an updated copy of the data source to the workbook in a content library. In this case, an actual log on operation is performed using the user name and password that is retrieved from a target application in Secure Store Service. Credentials can be the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] unattended data refresh account, or credentials that were stored with the data refresh schedule when it was created. For more information, see [Configure Stored Credentials for Power Pivot Data Refresh (Power Pivot for SharePoint)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/987eff0f-bcfe-4bbd-81e0-9aca993a2a75) and [Configure the Power Pivot Unattended Data Refresh Account (Power Pivot for SharePoint)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/81401eac-c619-4fad-ad3e-599e7a6f8493).  
  
##  <a name="Permissions"></a> SharePoint Permissions for Power Pivot Data Access  
 Publishing, managing, and securing a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbook is supported solely through SharePoint integration. SharePoint servers provide authentication and authorization subsystems that ensure legitimate access to data. There are no supported scenarios for securely deploying a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbook outside of a SharePoint farm.  
  
 User access to [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data is read-only on the server through View permissions or higher. Contribute permissions allow for adding and editing the file. Changes to [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data require that you download the workbook to an Excel desktop application that has [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for Excel installed. Contribute permissions on the file will determine whether the user can download the file locally and then save changes back to SharePoint.  
  
 As such, Contribute and View Only levels of permission define the effective set of permissions for user access to [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data. Other permission levels work to the extent that they have the same permissions as Contribute and View Only (For example, because Read includes View Only permissions, a user who is assigned to Read will have same level of access as View Only).  
  
 The following table summarizes the permission levels that determine access to [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data and server operations:  
  
|Permission level|Allows these tasks|  
|----------------------|------------------------|  
|Farm or service administrator|Install, enable, and configure services and applications.<br /><br /> Use [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Management Dashboard and view administrative reports.|  
|Full control|Activate [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] feature integration at the site collection level.<br /><br /> Create a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Gallery library.<br /><br /> Create a data feed library.|  
|Contribute|Add, edit, delete, and download [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks.<br /><br /> Configure data refresh.<br /><br /> Create new workbooks and reports based on [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks on a SharePoint site.<br /><br /> Create data service documents in a data feed library|  
|Read|Access [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks as an external data source, where the workbook URL is explicitly entered in a connection dialog box (for example, in Excel’s Data Connection Wizard).|  
|View Only|View [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks.<br /><br /> View data refresh history.<br /><br /> Connect a local workbook to a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbook on a SharePoint site, to repurpose its data in other ways.<br /><br /> Download a snapshot of the workbook. The snapshot is a static copy of the data, without slicers, filters, formulas, or data connections. The contents of the snapshot are similar to copying cell values from the browser window.|  
  
##  <a name="excel"></a> Excel Services security considerations for Power Pivot workbooks  
 [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] server-side query processing is tightly coupled with Excel services. Product integration begins at the document level, in that [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks are Excel workbook (.xlsx) files that either contain or reference [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data. There is no separate file extension for a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbook.  
  
 When a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbook is opened on a SharePoint site, Excel Services reads the embedded [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data connection string and forwards the request to the local SQL Server Analysis Services OLE DB provider. The provider then passes the connection information to a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] server in the farm. In order for requests to flow seamlessly between the two servers, Excel Services must be configured to use settings that are required by [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint.  
  
 In Excel Services, security-related configuration settings are specified on trusted locations, trusted data providers, and trusted data connection libraries. The following table describes the settings that enable or enhance [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data access. If a setting is not listed here, it has no effect on [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] server connections. For instructions on how to specify these settings step by step, see the section "Enable Excel Services" in [Initial Configuration (Power Pivot for SharePoint)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3a0ec2eb-017a-40db-b8d4-8aa8f4cdc146).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Most security-related settings apply to trusted locations. If you want to preserve default values or use different values for different sites, you can create an additional trusted location for sites that contain [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data, and then configure the following settings for just that site. For more information, see [Create a trusted location for Power Pivot sites in Central Administration](../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/create-a-trusted-location-for-power-pivot-sites-in-central-administration.md).  
  
|Area|Setting|Description|  
|----------|-------------|-----------------|  
|Web application|Windows authentication provider|[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] converts a claims token that it gets from Excel Services to a Windows user identity. Any web application that uses Excel Services as a resource must be configured to use the Windows authentication provider.|  
|Trusted location|Location Type|This value must be set to **Microsoft SharePoint Foundation**. [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] servers retrieve a copy of the .xlsx file and load it on an Analysis Services server in the farm. The server can only retrieve .xlsx files from a content library.|  
||Allow External Data|This value must be set to **Trusted data connection libraries and embedded**. [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data connections are embedded in the workbook. If you disallow embedded connections, users can view the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] cache, but they will not be able to interact with the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data.|  
||Warn on Refresh|This value should be disabled if you are using [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Gallery to store workbooks and reports. [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Gallery includes a document preview feature that works best if both refresh on open and Warn on Refresh are turned off.|  
|Trusted data providers|MSOLAP.4<br /><br /> MSOLAP.5|MSOLAP.4 is included by default, but [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data access requires that the MSOLAP.4 provider be the SQL Server 2008 R2 version.<br /><br /> MSOLAP.5 is installed with the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] version of [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint.<br /><br /> Do not remove these providers from the trusted data provider list. In some cases, you might need to install additional copies of this provider on other SharePoint servers in your farm. For more information, see [Install the Analysis Services OLE DB Provider on SharePoint Servers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2c62daf9-1f2d-4508-a497-af62360ee859).|  
|Trusted data connection libraries|Optional.|You can use Office Data Connection (.odc) files in [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks. If you use .odc files to provide connection information to local [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks, you can add the same .odc files to this library.|  
|User defined function assembly|Not applicable.|[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint ignores user-defined function assemblies that you build deploy for Excel Services. If you rely on user-defined assemblies for a specific behavior, be aware that [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../analysis-services/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] query processing will not use the user-defined functions you created.|
