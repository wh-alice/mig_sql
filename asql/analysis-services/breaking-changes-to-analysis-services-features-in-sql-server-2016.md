# Breaking Changes to Analysis Services Features in SQL Server 2016
  A *breaking change* causes a data model, application code, or script  to no longer function after upgrading either the model or the server.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In contrast, a *behavior change* is characterized as a code change that doesn't break a model or application, but does introduce a different behavior from a previous release.  Examples of behavior changes might include changing a default value, or disallowing a configuration of properties or options that was previously allowed. To learn more about behavior changes in this release, see [Behavior Changes to Analysis Services Features in SQL Server 2016](../analysis-services/behavior-changes-to-analysis-services-features-in-sql-server-2016.md).  
  
## .NET 4.0 version upgrade  
 Analysis Services Management Objects (AMO), ADOMD.NET, and Tabular Object Model (TOM) client libraries in [!INCLUDE[ssASCurrent](../analysis-services/includes/ssascurrent-md.md)] now target the .NET 4.0 runtime. This can be a breaking change for applications that target .NET 3.5. Applications using newer versions of these assemblies must now target .NET 4.0 or later.  
  
## AMO version upgrade  
 [!INCLUDE[ssASCurrent](../analysis-services/includes/ssascurrent-md.md)] is a version upgrade for [Analysis Services Management Objects &#40;AMO&#41;](../Topic/Analysis%20Services%20Management%20Objects%20\(AMO\).md) and is  a breaking change under certain circumstances.  Existing code and scripts that call into AMO will continue to run as before if you upgrade from a previous version. However, if you need to *recompile* your application and you are targeting a [!INCLUDE[ssASCurrent](../analysis-services/includes/ssascurrent-md.md)] instance, you must add the following namespace to make your code or script operational:  
  
```  
  
using Microsoft.AnalysisServices;  
using Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Core;  
  
```  
  
 The [Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Core](Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Core.xml) namespace is now required whenever you reference the Microsoft.AnalysisServices assembly in your code. Objects that were previously only in the **Microsoft.AnalysisServices** namespace are moved to the Core namespace in this release if the object is used the same way in both tabular and multidimensional scenarios.  For example, server-related APIs are relocated to the Core namespace.  
  
 Although there are now multiple namespaces, both exist in the same assembly (Microsoft.AnalysisServices.dll).  
  
## XEvent DISCOVER changes  
 To better support XEvent DISCOVER streaming in SSMS for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)], `DISCOVER_XEVENT_TRACE_DEFINITION` is replaced with the following XEvent traces:  
  
-   DISCOVER_XEVENT_PACKAGES  
  
-   DISCOVER_XEVENT_OBJECT  
  
-   DISCOVER_XEVENT_OBJECT_COLUMNS  
  
-   DISCOVER_XEVENT_SESSION_TARGETS
