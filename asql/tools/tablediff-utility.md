# tablediff Utility
  The **tablediff** utility is used to compare the data in two tables for non-convergence, and is particularly useful for troubleshooting non-convergence in a replication topology. This utility can be used from the command prompt or in a batch file to perform the following tasks:  
  
-   A row by row comparison between a source table in an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] acting as a replication Publisher and the destination table at one or more instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] acting as replication Subscribers.  
  
-   Perform a fast comparison by only comparing row counts and schema.  
  
-   Perform column-level comparisons.  
  
-   Generate a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] script to fix discrepancies at the destination server to bring the source and destination tables into convergence.  
  
-   Log results to an output file or into a table in the destination database.

## Arguments  
 [ **-?** ]  
 Returns the list of supported parameters.  
  
 **-sourceserver** *source_server_name*[**\\***instance_name*]  
 Is the name of the source server. Specify *source_server_name* for the default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Specify *source_server_name***\\***instance_name* for a named instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 **-sourcedatabase** *source_database*  
 Is the name of the source database.  
  
 **-sourcetable** *source_table_name*  
 Is the name of the source table being checked.  
  
 **-sourceschema** *source_schema_name*

 **-sourcepassword** *source_password*  
 Is the password for the login used to connect to the source server using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When possible, supply security credentials at runtime. If you must store credentials in a script file, you should secure the file to prevent unauthorized access.  
  
 **-sourceuser** *source_login*  
 Is the login used to connect to the source server using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication. If *source_login* is not supplied, then Windows Authentication is used when connecting to the source server. [!INCLUDE[ssNoteWinAuthentication](../a9retired/includes/ssnotewinauthentication-md.md)]  
  
 **-sourcelocked**  
 The source table is locked during the comparison using the TABLOCK and HOLDLOCK table hints.  
  
 **-destinationserver** *destination_server_name*[**\\***instance_name*]  
 Is the name of the destination server. Specify *destination_server_name* for the default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Specify *destination_server_name***\\***instance_name* for a named instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 **-destinationdatabase** *subscription_database*  
 Is the name of the destination database.  
  
 **-destinationtable** *destination_table*  
 Is the name of the destination table.  
  
 **-destinationschema** *destination_schema_name*  
 The schema owner of the destination table. By default, the table owner is assumed to be dbo.  
  
 **-destinationpassword** *destination_password*  
 Is the password for the login used to connect to the destination server using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When possible, supply security credentials at runtime. If you must store credentials in a script file, you should secure the file to prevent unauthorized access.  
  
 **-destinationuser** *destination_login*  
 Is the login used to connect to the destination server using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication. If *destination_login* is not supplied, then Windows Authentication is used when connecting to the server. [!INCLUDE[ssNoteWinAuthentication](../a9retired/includes/ssnotewinauthentication-md.md)]  
  
 **-destinationlocked**  
 The destination table is locked during the comparison using the TABLOCK and HOLDLOCK table hints.  
  
 **-b** *large_object_bytes*  
 Is the number of bytes to compare for large object data type columns, which includes: **text**, **ntext**, **image**, **varchar(max)**, **nvarchar(max)** and **varbinary(max)**. *large_object_bytes* defaults to the size of the column. Any data above *large_object_bytes* will not be compared.  
  
 **-bf**  *number_of_statements*  
 Is the number of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements to write to the current [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] script file when the **-f** option is used. When the number of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements exceeds *number_of_statements*, a new [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] script file is created.  
  
 **-c**  
 Compare column-level differences.  
  
 **-dt**  
 Drop the result table specified by *table_name*, if the table already exists.  
  
 **-et** *table_name*  
 Specifies the name of the result table to create. If this table already exists, **-DT** must be used or the operation will fail.  
  
 **-f** [ *file_name* ]  
 Generates a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] script to bring the table at the destination server into convergence with the table at the source server. You can optionally specify a name and path for the generated [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] script file. If *file_name* is not specified, the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] script file is generated in the directory where the utility runs.  
  
 **-o** *output_file_name*  
 Is the full name and path of the output file.  
  
 **-q**  
 Perform a fast comparison by only comparing row counts and schema.  
  
 **-rc** *number_of_retries*  
 Number of times that the utility retries a failed operation.  
  
 **-ri**  *retry_interval*  
 Interval, in seconds, to wait between retries.  
  
 **-strict**

 **-t** *connection_timeouts*  
 Sets the connection timeout period, in seconds, for connections to the source server and destination server.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**0**|Success|  
|**1**|Critical error|  
|**2**|Table differences|  
  
## Remarks  
 The **tablediff** utility cannot be used with non-[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] servers.  
  
 Tables with **sql_variant** data type columns are not supported.  
  
 By default, the **tablediff** utility supports the following data type mappings between source and destination columns.  
  
|Source data type|Destination data type|  
|----------------------|---------------------------|  
|**tinyint**|**smallint**, **int**, or **bigint**|  
|**smallint**|**int** or **bigint**|  
|**int**|**bigint**|  
|**timestamp**|**varbinary**|  
|**varchar(max)**|**text**|  
|**nvarchar(max)**|**ntext**|  
|**varbinary(max)**|**image**|  
|**text**|**varchar(max)**|  
|**ntext**|**nvarchar(max)**|  
|**image**|**varbinary(max)**|  
  
 Use the **-strict** option to disallow these mappings and perform a strict validation.  
  
 The source table in the comparison must contain at least one primary key, identity, or ROWGUID column. When you use the **-strict** option, the destination table must also have a primary key, identity, or ROWGUID column.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] script generated to bring the destination table into convergence does not include the following data types:  
  
-   **varchar(max)**  
  
-   **nvarchar(max)**  
  
-   **varbinary(max)**  
  
-   **timestamp**  
  
-   **xml**  
  
-   **text**  
  
-   **ntext**  
  
-   **image**  
  
## Permissions  
 To compare tables, you need SELECT ALL permissions on the table objects being compared.  
  
 To use the **-et** option, you must be a member of the db_owner fixed database role, or at least have CREATE TABLE permission in the subscription database and ALTER permission on the destination owner schema at the destination server.  
  
 To use the **-dt** option, you must be a member of the db_owner fixed database role, or at least have ALTER permission on the destination owner schema at the destination server.  
  
 To use the **-o** or **-f** options, you must have write permissions to the specified file directory location.
