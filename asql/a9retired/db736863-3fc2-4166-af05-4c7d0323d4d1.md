# Advanced Data Source View Options Dialog Box (Data Source View Wizard) (Analysis Services)
  The **Advanced Data Source View Options** dialog box gives you additional control over how the data source view pulls schemas and relationships from the data source to build the view.  
  
 To open the **Advanced Data Source View Options** dialog box, in Data Source View Wizard, on the **Select a Data Source** page, click **Advanced**.  
  
## Options  
 **Retrieve relationships**  
 Indicates whether relationship details should be retrieved from the data source and applied to the data source view. If you change this option after the relationships have been created, no existing relationships are removed from the data source view.  
  
 **Restrict to Schema(s)**  
 Use to specify a comma separated list of schema names that restricts the schemas that are retrieved from the data source. If there are no schema names listed for this option, there are no restrictions on the schemas that can be used.
