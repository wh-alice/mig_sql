# SQL Server Native Client Features
[!INCLUDE[SNAC_Deprecated](../../../a9retired/includes/snac-deprecated.md)]

  In addition to exposing features of the Windows (formerly Microsoft) Data Access Components (WDAC), [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client also implements many other features to expose [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] functionality.

 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports the use of mirrored databases, which is the ability to keep a copy, or mirror, of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database on a standby server.  
  
 [Performing Asynchronous Operations](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/performing-asynchronous-operations.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports asynchronous operations, which is the ability to return immediately without blocking on the calling thread.  
  
 [Using Multiple Active Result Sets &#40;MARS&#41;](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/using-multiple-active-result-sets-mars.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports multiple active result sets (MARS). MARS enables you to execute and receive multiple result sets using a single database connection  
  
 [Using XML Data Types](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/using-xml-data-types.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports the XML data type, which is a XML-based data type that can be used as a column type, variable type, parameter type, or function return type.  
  
 [Using User-Defined Types](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/using-user-defined-types.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports User-Defined Types (UDT), which extends the SQL type system by allowing you to store objects and custom data structures in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database.  
  
 [Using Large Value Types](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/using-large-value-types.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports large value data types, which are large object data types (LOB).  
  
 [Changing Passwords Programmatically](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/changing-passwords-programmatically.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports the handling of expired passwords so that passwords can now be changed on the client without administrator involvement.  
  
 [Working with Snapshot Isolation](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/working-with-snapshot-isolation.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports the enhancement to row versioning that improves database performance by avoiding reader-writer blocking scenarios.  
  
 [Working with Query Notifications](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/working-with-query-notifications.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports consumer notification on rowset modification.  
  
 [Performing Bulk Copy Operations](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/performing-bulk-copy-operations.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports bulk copy operations that allow the transfer of large amounts of data into or out of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table or view.  
  
 [Using Encryption Without Validation](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/using-encryption-without-validation.md)  
 Discusses how to use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client to encrypt data sent to the server without validating the certificate.  
  
 [Table-Valued Parameters &#40;SQL Server Native Client&#41;](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/table-valued-parameters-sql-server-native-client.md)  
 Discusses [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client support for the table-valued parameters.  
  
 [Large CLR User-Defined Types](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/large-clr-user-defined-types.md)  
 Discusses support for large common language runtime (CLR) user-defined types (UDTs).  
  
 [FILESTREAM Support](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/filestream-support.md)  
 Discusses [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client support for the enhanced FILESTREAM feature.  
  
 [Service Principal Name &#40;SPN&#41; Support in Client Connections](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/service-principal-name-spn-support-in-client-connections.md)

 Discusses a behavior change introduced in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql11-md.md)]. If you supply a fixed-length buffer when binding a column result or output parameter and if the **wchar** character written into the buffer before the terminating character is a high surrogate code point of a surrogate pair, and if the next **wchar** character is a low surrogate code point, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client will not add the high surrogate code point to the buffer.  
  
 [SQL Server Native Client Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/sql-server-native-client-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md)
