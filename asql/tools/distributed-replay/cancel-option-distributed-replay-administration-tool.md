# Cancel Option (Distributed Replay Administration Tool)
  The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay administration tool, **DReplay.exe**, is a command-line tool that you can use to communicate with the distributed replay controller. This topic describes the **cancel** command-line option and corresponding syntax.  
  
 The **cancel** option cancels the current operation that is running on the controller.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") For more information about the syntax conventions that are used with the administration tool syntax, see [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
dreplay cancel [-m controller] [-q]   
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 **-m** *controller*  
 The computer name of the controller. You can use "`localhost`" or "`.`" to refer to the local computer.  
  
 If the **-m** parameter is not specified, the local computer is used.  
  
 **-q**  
 Quiet mode. Does not prompt for confirmation.  
  
 The **-q** parameter is optional.  
  
## Examples  
 In the following example, a cancel request is submitted in quiet mode. The value `localhost` indicates that the controller service is running on the same computer as the administration tool.  
  
```  
dreplay cancel â€“m localhost -q  
```  
  
## Permissions  
 You must run the administration tool as an interactive user, as either a local user or a domain user account. To use a local user account, the administration tool and controller must be running on the same computer.
