# sp_pdw_log_user_data_masking (SQL Data Warehouse)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-xxxx-asdw-pdw_md](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/includes/tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-xxxx-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

  Use **sp_pdw_log_user_data_masking** to enable user data masking in [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs. User data masking affects the statements on all databases on the appliance.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs affected by **sp_pdw_log_user_data_masking** are certain [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs. **sp_pdw_log_user_data_masking** does not affect database transaction logs, or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error logs.  
  
 **Background:** In the default configuration [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs contain full [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, and can in some cases include user data contained in operations such as **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **SELECT** statements. In case of a problem on the appliance, this permits the analysis of the conditions that caused the problem without a need to reproduce the issue. In order to prevent the user data from being written to [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs, customers can choose to turn on the user data masking by using this stored procedure. The statements will still be written to [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs, but all the literals in statements that may contain user data will be masked; replaced with some predefined constant values.  
  
 When transparent data encryption is enabled on the appliance, masking of the user data in [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs is automatically turned on.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
-- Syntax for Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
sp_pdw_log_user_data_masking [ [ @masking_mode = ] value ] ;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 [ **@masking_mode=** ] *masking_mode*  
 Determines whether transparent data encryption log user data masking is enabled. *masking_mode* is **int**, and can be one of the following values:  
  
-   0 = Disabled, user data appears in the [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs.  
  
-   1 = Enabled, user data statements appear in the [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs but the user data is masked.  
  
-   2 = Statements containing user data are not written to the [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs.  
  
 Executing **sp_pdw_ log_user_data_masking** without parameters returns the current state of TDE log user data masking on the appliance as a scalar result set.  
  
## Remarks  
 User data masking in [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs enables replacement of literals with predefined constant values in **SELECT** and DML statements, as they can contain user data. Setting *masking_mode* to 1 does not mask metadata, such as column names or table names. Setting *masking_mode* to 2 removes statements with metadata, such as column names or table names.  
  
 User data masking in [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs is implemented in the following way:  
  
-   TDE and user data masking in [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs are turned off by default. The statements will not be automatically masked if database encryption is not enabled on the appliance.  
  
-   Enabling TDE on the appliance automatically turns on the user data masking in [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs.  
  
-   Disabling TDE does not affect user data masking in [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs.  
  
-   You can explicitly enable user data masking in [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssdw-md.md)] activity logs by using the **sp_pdw_log_user_data_masking** procedure.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires membership in the **sysadmin** fixed database role, or **CONTROL SERVER** permission.  
  
## Example  
 The following example enables TDE log user data masking on the appliance.  
  
```  
EXEC sp_pdw_log_user_data_masking 1;  
```
