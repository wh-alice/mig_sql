# + (Add) (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Adds two numbers. This addition arithmetic operator can also add a number, in days, to a date.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
-- Syntax for SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Parallel Data Warehouse  
    
expression + expression  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *expression*  
 Is any valid [expression](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) of any one of the data types in the numeric category except the **bit** data type. Cannot be used with **date**, **time**, **datetime2**, or **datetimeoffset** data types.  
  
## Result Types  
 Returns the data type of the argument with the higher precedence. For more information, see [Data Type Precedence &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/data-types/data-type-precedence-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using the addition operator to calculate the total number of hours away from work for each employee.  
 This example finds the total number of hours away from work for each employee by adding the number of hours taken for vacation and the number of hours taken as sick leave.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, VacationHours, SickLeaveHours,   
    VacationHours + SickLeaveHours AS 'Total Hours Away'  
FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e  
    JOIN Person.Person AS p ON e.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID  
ORDER BY 'Total Hours Away' ASC;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Using the addition operator to add days to date and time values  
 This example adds a number of days to a `datetime` date.  
  
```  
  
SET NOCOUNT ON  
DECLARE @startdate datetime, @adddays int;  
SET @startdate = ''January 10, 1900 12:00 AM';  
SET @adddays = 5;  
SET NOCOUNT OFF;  
SELECT @startdate + 1.25 AS 'Start Date',   
   @startdate + @adddays AS 'Add Date';  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 `Start Date                  Add Date`  
  
 `--------------------------- ---------------------------`  
  
 `1900-01-11 06:00:00.000     1900-01-15 00:00:00.000`  
  
 `(1 row(s) affected)`  
  
### C. Adding character and integer data types  
 The following example adds an **int** data type value and a character value by converting the character data type to **int**. If a character that is not valid exists in the **char** string, the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] returns an error.  
  
```  
DECLARE @addvalue int;  
SET @addvalue = 15;  
SELECT '125127' + @addvalue;  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 `-----------------------`  
  
 `125142`  
  
 `(1 row(s) affected)`  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
  
### D: Using the addition operator to calculate the total number of hours away from work for each employee  
 The following example finds the total number of hours away from work for each employee by adding the number of hours taken for vacation and the number of hours taken as sick leave and sorts the results in ascending order.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT FirstName, LastName, VacationHours, SickLeaveHours,   
    VacationHours + SickLeaveHours AS TotalHoursAway  
FROM DimEmployee  
ORDER BY TotalHoursAway ASC;  
```
