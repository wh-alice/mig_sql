# Report Builder Functions - LookupSet Function
  Returns the set of matching values for the specified name from a dataset that contains name/value pairs.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../reporting-services/report-builder/includes/ssrbrddup-md.md)]  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
LookupSet(source_expression, destination_expression, result_expression, dataset)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *source_expression*  
 (**Variant**) An expression that is evaluated in the current scope and that specifies the name or key to look up. For example, `=Fields!ID.Value`.  
  
 *destination_expression*  
 (**Variant**) An expression that is evaluated for each row in a dataset and that specifies the name or key to match on. For example, `=Fields!CustomerID.Value`.  
  
 *result_expression*  
 (**Variant**) An expression that is evaluated for the row in the dataset where *source_expression* = *destination_expression*, and that specifies the value to retrieve. For example, `=Fields!PhoneNumber.Value`.  
  
 *dataset*  
 A constant that specifies the name of a dataset in the report. For example, "ContactInformation".  
  
## Return  
 Returns a **VariantArray**, or **Nothing** if there is no match.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use **LookupSet** to retrieve a set of values from the specified dataset for a name/value pair where there is a 1-to-many relationship. For example, for a customer identifier in a table, you can use **LookupSet** to retrieve all the associated phone numbers for that customer from a dataset that is not bound to the data region.  
  
 **LookupSet** does the following:  
  
-   Evaluates the source expression in the current scope.  
  
-   Evaluates the destination expression for each row of the specified dataset after filters have been applied, based on the collation of the specified dataset.  
  
-   For each match of source expression and destination expression, evaluates the result expression for that row in the dataset.  
  
-   Returns the set of result expression values.  
  
 To retrieve a single value from a dataset with name/value pairs for a specified name where there is a 1-to-1 relationship, use [Lookup Function &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/report-builder-functions-lookup-function.md). To call **Lookup** for a set of values, use [Multilookup Function &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/report-builder-functions-multilookup-function.md).  
  
 The following restrictions apply:  
  
-   **LookupSet** is evaluated after all filter expressions are applied.  
  
-   Only one level of lookup is supported. A source, destination, or result expression cannot include a reference to a lookup function.  
  
-   Source and destination expressions must evaluate to the same data type.  
  
-   Source, destination, and result expressions cannot include references to report or group variables.  
  
-   **LookupSet** cannot be used as an expression for the following report items:  
  
    -   Dynamic connection strings for a data source.  
  
    -   Calculated fields in a dataset.  
  
    -   Query parameters in a dataset.  
  
    -   Filters in a dataset.  
  
    -   Report parameters.  
  
    -   The Report.Language property.  
  
 For more information, see [Aggregate Functions Reference &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/report-builder-functions-aggregate-functions-reference.md) and [Expression Scope for Totals, Aggregates, and Built-in Collections &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/expression-scope-for-totals-aggregates-and-built-in-collections.md).  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, assume the table is bound to a dataset that includes a sales territory identifier TerritoryGroupID. A separate dataset called "Stores" contains the list of all stores in a territory and includes the territory identifier ID and the name of the store StoreName.  
  
 In the following expression, **LookupSet** compares the value TerritoryGroupID to ID for each row in the dataset called "Stores". For each match, the value of the StoreName field for that row is added to the result set.  
  
```  
=LookupSet(Fields!TerritoryGroupID.Value, Fields!ID.Value, Fields!StoreName.Value, "Stores")  
```  
  
## Example  
 Because **LookupSet** returns a collection of objects, you cannot display the result expression directly in a text box. You can concatenate the value of each object in the collection as a string.  
  
 Use the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] function **Join** create a delimited string from a set of objects. Use a comma as a separator to combine the objects in a single line. In some renderers, you might use a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] line feed (`vbCrLF`) as a separator to list each value on a new line.  
  
 The following expression, when it is used as the Value property for a text box, uses **Join** to create a list.  
  
```  
=Join(LookupSet(Fields!TerritoryGroupID.Value, Fields!ID.Value, Fields!StoreName.Value, "Stores"),",")  
```  
  
## Example  
 For text boxes that only render a few times, you might choose to add custom code to generate HTML to display values in a text box. HTML in a text box requires extra processing, so this would not be a good choice for a text box that is rendered thousands of times.  
  
 Copy the following [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] functions to a Code block in a report definition. **MakeList** takes the object array that is returned in *result_expression* and builds an unordered list by using HTML tags. **Length** returns the number of items in the object array.  
  
```  
Function MakeList(ByVal items As Object()) As String  
   If items Is Nothing Then  
      Return Nothing  
   End If  
  
   Dim builder As System.Text.StringBuilder =   
      New System.Text.StringBuilder()  
   builder.Append("<ul>")  
  
   For Each item As Object In items  
      builder.Append("<li>")  
      builder.Append(item)  
   Next  
   builder.Append("</ul>")  
  
   Return builder.ToString()  
End Function  
  
Function Length(ByVal items as Object()) as Integer  
   If items is Nothing Then  
      Return 0  
   End If  
   Return items.Length  
End Function  
```  
  
## Example  
 To generate the HTML, you must call the function. Paste the following expression in the Value property for the text box and set the markup type for text to HTML. For more information, see [Add HTML into a Report &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/add-html-into-a-report-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
```  
=Code.MakeList(LookupSet(Fields!TerritoryGroupID.Value, Fields!ID.Value, Fields!StoreName.Value, "Stores"))  
```
