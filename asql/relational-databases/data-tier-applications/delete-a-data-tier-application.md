# Delete a Data-tier Application
  You can delete a data-tier application by using either the Delete Data-tier Application wizard or a Windows PowerShell script. You can specify whether the associated database is retained, detached, or dropped.  
  
-   **Before you begin:**  [Limitations and Restrictions](#LimitationsRestrictions), [Permissions](#Permissions)  
  
-   **To upgrade a DAC, using:**  [The Register Data-tier Application Wizard](#UsingDeleteDACWizard), [PowerShell](#DeleteDACPowerShell)  
  
## Before You Begin  
 When you delete a data-tier application (DAC) instance, you choose one of three options specifying what is to be done with the database associated with the data-tier application. All three options delete the DAC definition metadata. The options differ in what they do with the database associated with the data-tier application. The wizard does not delete any of the instance-level objects associated with the DAC or database, such as logins.  
  
|Option|Database actions|  
|------------|----------------------|  
|Delete registration|The associated database remains intact.|  
|Detach database|The associated database is detached. The instance of the Database Engine cannot reference the database, but the data and log files are intact.|  
|Delete database|The associated database is dropped. The data and log files are deleted.|  
  
###  <a name="LimitationsRestrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
 There is no automatic mechanism to restore the DAC definition metadata or the database after you delete a DAC. How you can manually rebuild the DAC instance depends on the delete option.  
  
|Option|How to Rebuild the DAC Instance|  
|------------|-------------------------------------|  
|Delete registration|Register a DAC from the database left in place.|  
|Detach database|Re-attach the database by using **sp_attachdb** or [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], and then register a new DAC instance from the database.|  
|Delete database|Restore the database from a full backup made before the DAC was deleted, and then register a new DAC instance from the database.|  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  Rebuilding a DAC instance by registering a DAC from a restored or re-attached database will not recreate some parts of the original DAC, such as the server selection policy.  
  
###  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 A DAC can only be deleted by members of the **sysadmin** or **serveradmin** fixed server roles, or by the database owner. The built-in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system administrator account named **sa** can also launch the wizard.  
  
##  <a name="UsingDeleteDACWizard"></a> Using the Delete Data-tier Application Wizard  
 **To Delete a DAC Using a Wizard**  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, expand the node for the instance containing the DAC to be deleted.  
  
2.  Expand the **Management** node.  
  
3.  Expand the **Data-tier Applications** node.  
  
4.  Right-click the DAC to be deleted, and then select **Delete Data-tier Applicationâ€¦**  
  
5.  Complete the wizard dialogs:  
  
    1.  [Introduction](#Introduction)  
  
    2.  [Choose Method](#Choose_method)  
  
    3.  [Summary](#Summary)

 [Using the Delete Data-tier Application Wizard](#UsingDeleteDACWizard)  
  
##  <a name="Choose_method"></a> Choose Method Page  
 Use this page to specify the option for handling the database associated with the DAC to be deleted.  
  
 **Delete registration** - Removes the metadata defining the data-tier application, but leaves the associated database intact.  
  
 **Detach database** - Removes the metadata defining the data-tier application and detaches the associated database.  
  
 The database can no longer be referenced by that instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)], but the data and log files remain intact.  
  
 **Delete database** - Removes the metadata defining the DAC and drops the associated database.  
  
 The data and log files for the database are permanently deleted.  
  
 **\< Previous** - Returns to the **Introduction** page.  
  
 **Next >** - Proceeds to the **Summary** page.  
  
 **Cancel** - Ends the wizard without deleting the DAC or database.

##  <a name="Summary"></a> Summary Page  
 Use this page to review the actions the wizard will take when deleting the DAC instance.  
  
 **Review your selection summary** - Review the DAC, database, and deletion method displayed in the box. If the information is correct, select either **Next** or **Finish** to delete the DAC. If the DAC and database information is not correct, select **Cancel** and select the correct DAC. If the deletion method is not correct, select **Previous** to return to the **Choose Method** page and select a different method.  
  
 **\< Previous** - Returns to the **Choose Method** page to choose a different delete method.  
  
 **Next >** - Deletes the DAC instance using the method you chose on the previous page, and proceeds to the **Delete Data-tier Application** page.  
  
 **Cancel** - Ends the wizard without deleting the DAC instance.

##  <a name="DeleteDACPowerShell"></a> Delete a DAC Using PowerShell  
 **To delete a DAC using a PowerShell script**  
  
1.  Create a SMO Server object and set it to the instance that contains the DAC to be deleted.  
  
2.  Open a **ServerConnection** object and connect to the same instance.  
  
3.  Use **add_DacActionStarted** and **add_DacActionFinished** to subscribe to the DAC upgrade events.  
  
4.  Specify the DAC to delete.  
  
5.  Use one of these three sets of code, depending on which delete option is appropriate:  
  
    -   To delete the DAC registration but leave the database intact, use the **Unmanage()** method.  
  
    -   To delete the DAC registration and detach the database, use the **Uninstall()** method and specify **DetachDatabase**.  
  
    -   To delete the DAC registration and drop the database, use the **Uninstall()** method and specify **DropDatabase**.  
  
### Example Deleting the DAC but Leaving the Database (PowerShell)  
 The following example deletes a DAC named MyApplication using the **Unmanage()** method to delete the DAC but leave the database intact.  
  
```  
## Set a SMO Server object to the default instance on the local computer.  
CD SQLSERVER:\SQL\localhost\DEFAULT  
$srv = get-item .  
  
## Open a Common.ServerConnection to the same instance.  
$serverconnection = New-Object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection($srv.ConnectionContext.SqlConnectionObject)  
$serverconnection.Connect()  
$dacstore = New-Object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Dac.DacStore($serverconnection)  
  
## Subscribe to the DAC delete events.  
$dacstore.add_DacActionStarted({Write-Host `n`nStarting at $(get-date) :: $_.Description})  
$dacstore.add_DacActionFinished({Write-Host Completed at $(get-date) :: $_.Description})  
  
## Specify the DAC to delete.  
$dacName  = "MyApplication"  
  
## Only delete the DAC definition from msdb, the associated database remains active.  
$dacstore.Unmanage($dacName)  
```  
  
 [Delete a DAC Using PowerShell](#DeleteDACPowerShell)  
  
### Example Deleting the DAC and Detaching the Database (PowerShell)  
 The following example deletes a DAC named MyApplication using the **Uninstall()** method to delete the DAC and detach the database.  
  
```  
## Set a SMO Server object to the default instance on the local computer.  
CD SQLSERVER:\SQL\localhost\DEFAULT  
$srv = get-item .  
  
## Open a Common.ServerConnection to the same instance.  
$serverconnection = New-Object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection($srv.ConnectionContext.SqlConnectionObject)  
$serverconnection.Connect()  
$dacstore = New-Object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Dac.DacStore($serverconnection)  
  
## Subscribe to the DAC delete events.  
$dacstore.add_DacActionStarted({Write-Host `n`nStarting at $(get-date) :: $_.Description})  
$dacstore.add_DacActionFinished({Write-Host Completed at $(get-date) :: $_.Description})  
  
## Specify the DAC to delete.  
$dacName  = "MyApplication"  
  
## Delete the DAC definition from msdb and detach the associated database.  
$dacstore.Uninstall($dacName, [Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Dac.DacUninstallMode]::DetachDatabase)  
```  
  
 [Delete a DAC Using PowerShell](#DeleteDACPowerShell)  
  
### Example Deleting the DAC and Dropping the Database (PowerShell)  
 The following example deletes a DAC named MyApplication using the **Uninstall()** method to delete the DAC and drop the database.  
  
```  
## Set a SMO Server object to the default instance on the local computer.  
CD SQLSERVER:\SQL\localhost\DEFAULT  
$srv = get-item .  
  
## Open a Common.ServerConnection to the same instance.
