# SQLXML 4.0 Data Access Components - SQLXMLOLEDB Provider
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] SQLXML 4.0 includes three data providers that can insert XML data into and retrieve XML data from a database in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
-   SQLXMLOLEDB Provider  
  
     Exposes SQLXML 4.0 functionality through ActiveX Data Objects (ADO).  
  
-   SQLXML Managed Classes  
  
     Expose SQLXML functionality inside the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework. For more information, see [SQLXML Managed Classes](../../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-xpath-queries/net-framework-classes/sqlxml-4.0-.net-framework-support-managed-classes.md).  
  
-   SQL Server Native Client (SQLNCLI11)  
  
     Exposes SQLXML 4.0 functionality through a new data access technology that extends and compliments current versions of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC). SQLNCLI11 provides full support for features introduced in [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)]. For more information, see [SQL Server Native Client Programming](../../../relational-databases/native-client/sql-server-native-client-programming.md).
