# Principals (Database Engine)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  *Principals* are entities that can request [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resources. Like other components of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] authorization model, principals can be arranged in a hierarchy. The scope of influence of a principal depends on the scope of the definition of the principal: Windows, server, database; and whether the principal is indivisible or a collection. A Windows Login is an example of an indivisible principal, and a Windows Group is an example of a principal that is a collection. Every principal has a security identifier (SID). This topic applies to all version of SQL Server, but there are some restictions on server-level principals in SQL Database or SQL Data Warehouse. 
  
## SQL Server-level principals  
  
-  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] authentication Login   
-  Windows authentication login for a Windows user  
-  Windows authentication login for a Windows group   
-  Azure Active Directory authentication login for a AD user
-  Azure Active Directory authentication login for a AD group
-  Server Role  
  
 ## Database-level principals  
  
-   Database User (There are 11 types of users. For more information, see [CREATE USER](../../../t-sql/statements/create-user-transact-sql.md).) 
-   Database Role  
-   Application Role  
  
## sa Login  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] `sa` log in is a server-level principal. By default, it is created when an instance is installed. Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)], the default database of sa is master. This is a change of behavior from earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The `sa` login is a member of the `sysadmin` fixed database role. The `sa` login has all permissions on the server and cannot be limited. The `sa` login cannot be dropped, but it can be disabled so that no one can use it.

## dbo User and dbo Schema

The `dbo` use is a special user principal in each database. All SQL Server administrators, members of the `sysadmin` fixed server role, `sa` login, and owners of the database, enter databases as the `dbo` user. The `dbo` user has all permissions in the database and cannot be limited or dropped. `dbo` stands for database owner, but the `dbo`user account is not the same as the `db_owner` fixed database role, and the `db_owner` fixed database role is not the same as the user account that is recorded as the owner of the database.     
The `dbo` user owns the `dbo` schema. The `dbo` schema is the default schema for all users, unless some other schema is specified.  The `dbo` schema cannot be dropped.
  
## public Server Role and Database Role  
Every login belongs to the `public` fixed server role, and every database user belongs to the `public` database role. When a login or user has not been granted or denied specific permissions on a securable, the login or user inherits the permissions granted to public on that securable. The `public` fixed server role and the `public` fixed database role cannot be dropped. However you can revoke permissions from the `public` roles. There are many permissions that are assigned to the `public` roles by default. Most of these permissions are needed for routine operations in the database; the type of things that everyone should be able to do. Be careful when revoking permissions from the public login or user, as it will affect all logins/users. Generally you should not deny permissions to public, because the deny statement overrides any grant statements you might make to individuals. 
  
## INFORMATION_SCHEMA and sys Users and Schemas 
 Every database includes two entities that appear as users in catalog views: `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` and `sys`. These entities are required for internal use by the Database Engine. They cannot be modified or dropped.  
  
## Certificate-based SQL Server Logins  
 Server principals with names enclosed by double hash marks (##) are for internal system use only. The following principals are created from certificates when [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed, and should not be deleted.  
  
-   \##MS_SQLResourceSigningCertificate##    
-   \##MS_SQLReplicationSigningCertificate##    
-   \##MS_SQLAuthenticatorCertificate##    
-   \##MS_AgentSigningCertificate##   
-   \##MS_PolicyEventProcessingLogin##   
-   \##MS_PolicySigningCertificate##   
-   \##MS_PolicyTsqlExecutionLogin##   
  
## The guest User  
 Each database includes a `guest`. Permissions granted to the `guest` user are inherited by users who have access to the database, but who do not have a user account in the database. The `guest` user cannot be dropped, but it can be disabled by revoking it's CONNECT permission. The CONNECT permission can be revoked by executing `REVOKE CONNECT FROM GUEST;` within any database other than `master` or `tempdb`.
