# DBCC TRACEON - Trace Flags (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../integration-services/system/stored-procedures/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Trace flags are used to temporarily set specific server characteristics or to switch off a particular behavior. For example, if trace flag 3205 is set when an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] starts, hardware compression for tape drivers is disabled. Trace flags are frequently used to diagnose performance issues or to debug stored procedures or complex computer systems.  
  
 The following table lists and describes the trace flags that are available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
 
> [!NOTE]
> Some trace flags were introduced in specific [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] versions. For more information on the applicable version, see the Microsoft Support article associated with a specific trace flag.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Trace flag behavior may not be supported in future releases of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. 


  
|Trace flag|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|
|**139**| Forces correct conversion semantics in the scope of DBCC check commands like [DBCC CHECKDB](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkdb-transact-sql.md), [DBCC CHECKTABLE](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checktable-transact-sql.md) and [DBCC CHECKCONSTRAINTS](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkconstraints-transact-sql.md), when analyzing the improved precision and conversion logic introduced with compatibility level 130 for specific data types, on a database that has a lower compatibility level. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/help/4010261).<br /><br />**Note:** This trace flag applies to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] RTM CU3, [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1 and higher builds.<br /><br />**WARNING:** Trace flag 139 is not meant to be enabled continuously in a production environment, and should be used for the sole purpose of performing database validation checks described in this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/help/4010261). It should be immediately disabled after validation checks are completed.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**174**|Increases the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] plan cache bucket count from 40,009 to 160,001 on 64-bit systems. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3026083).<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**205**|Reports to the error log when a statistics-dependent stored procedure is being recompiled as a result of auto-update statistics. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/195565).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**260**|Prints versioning information about extended stored procedure dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). For more information about **GetXpVersion()**, see [Creating Extended Stored Procedures](../../relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-programming/creating-extended-stored-procedures.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** global or session|
|**610**|Controls minimally logged inserts into indexed tables. For more information, see [Data Loading Performance Guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd425070.aspx).<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|
|**634**|Disables the background columnstore compression task. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] periodically runs the Tuple Mover background task that compresses columnstore index rowgroups with uncompressed data, one such rowgroup at a time.<br /><br />Columnstore compression improves query performance but also consumes system resources. You can control the timing of columnstore compression manually, by disabling the background compression task with trace flag 634, and then explicitly invoking **ALTER INDEX REORGANIZE** or **ALTER INDEX REBUILD** at the time of your choice.<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|
|**652**|Disables page pre-fetching scans. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920093).<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|
|**661**|Disables the ghost record removal process. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920093).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**715**|Enables table lock for bulk load operations into a heap with no non-clustered indexes. When this trace flag is enabled, bulk load operations acquire bulk update (BU) locks when bulk copying data into a table. Bulk update (BU) locks allow multiple threads to bulk load data concurrently into the same table, while preventing other processes that are not bulk loading data from accessing the table.<br /><br />The behavior is similar to when the user explicitly specifies **TABLOCK** hint while performing bulk load, or when the **sp_tableoption** table lock on bulk load is enabled for a given table. However, when this trace flag is enabled, this behavior becomes default without any query or database changes.<br /><br />**Scope:** global or session|
|**834**|Uses Microsoft Windows large-page allocations for the buffer pool. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3210239).<br /><br />**Note:** If you are using the Columnstore Index feature of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)], we do not recommend turning on trace flag 834.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**902**|Bypasses execution of database upgrade script when installing a Cumulative Update or Service Pack. If you encounter an error during script upgrade mode, it is recommended to contact Microsoft SQL Customer Service and Support (CSS) for further guidance. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2163980).<br /><br />**WARNING:** This trace flag is meant for troubleshooting of failed updates during script upgrade mode, and it is not supported to run it continuously in a production environment. Database upgrade scripts needs to execute successfully for a complete install of Cumulative Updates and Service Packs. Not doing so can cause unexpected issues with your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**1117**|When a file in the filegroup meets the autogrow threshold, all files in the filegroup grow.<br /><br />**Note:** Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] this behavior is controlled by the AUTOGROW_SINGLE_FILE and AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES option of ALTER DATABASE, and trace flag 1117 has no affect. For more information, see [ALTER DATABASE File and Filegroup Options &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-file-and-filegroup-options.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|
|**1118**|Removes most single page allocations on the server, reducing contention on the SGAM page. When a new object is created, by default, the first eight pages are allocated from different extents (mixed extents). Afterwards, when more pages are needed, those are allocated from that same extent (uniform extent). The SGAM page is used to track these mixed extents, so can quickly become a bottleneck when numerous mixed page allocations are occurring. This trace flag allocates all eight pages from the same extent when creating new objects, minimizing the need to scan the SGAM page. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/328551).<br /><br />**Note:** Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] this behavior is controlled by the SET MIXED_PAGE_ALLOCATION option of ALTER DATABASE, and trace flag 1118 has no affect. For more information, see [ALTER DATABASE SET Options &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-set-options.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|  
|**1204**|Returns the resources and types of locks participating in a deadlock and also the current command affected. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/832524).<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|  
|**1211**|Disables lock escalation based on memory pressure, or based on number of locks. The [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] will not escalate row or page locks to table locks.<br /><br />Using this trace flag can generate excessive numbers of locks. This can slow the performance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)], or cause 1204 errors (unable to allocate lock resource) because of insufficient memory.<br /><br />If both trace flag 1211 and 1224 are set, 1211 takes precedence over 1224. However, because trace flag 1211 prevents escalation in every case, even under memory pressure, we recommend that you use 1224. This helps avoid "out-of-locks" errors when many locks are being used.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|  
|**1222**|Returns the resources and types of locks that are participating in a deadlock and also the current command affected, in an XML format that does not comply with any XSD schema.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|  
|**1224**|Disables lock escalation based on the number of locks. However, memory pressure can still activate lock escalation. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] escalates row or page locks to table (or partition) locks if the amount of memory used by lock objects exceeds one of the following conditions:<br /><br />-   Forty percent of the memory that is used by [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)]. This is applicable only when the **locks** parameter of **sp_configure** is set to 0.<br />-   Forty percent of the lock memory that is configured by using the **locks** parameter of **sp_configure**. For more information, see [Server Configuration Options &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../database-engine/configure/windows/server-configuration-options-sql-server.md).<br /><br />If both trace flag 1211 and 1224 are set, 1211 takes precedence over 1224. However, because trace flag 1211 prevents escalation in every case, even under memory pressure, we recommend that you use 1224. This helps avoid "out-of-locks" errors when many locks are being used.<br /><br />**Note:** Lock escalation to the table-level or HoBT-level granularity can also be controlled by using the LOCK_ESCALATION option of the [ALTER TABLE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) statement.<br /><br />**Scope:** global or session|
|**1236**|Enables database lock partitioning. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2926217).<br /><br />**Note:** Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] SP3 and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] SP1 this behavior is controlled by the engine and trace flag 1236 has no effect.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**1260**|Disable scheduler monitor dumps.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|   
|**1448**|Enables the replication log reader to move forward even if the async secondaries have not acknowledged the reception of a change. Even with this trace flag enabled the log reader always waits for the sync secondaries. The log reader will not go beyond the min ack of the sync secondaries. This trace flag applies to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], not just an availability group, an availability database, or a log reader instance. Takes effect immediately without a restart. This trace flag can be activated ahead of time or when an async secondary fails. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/937041).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|   
|**1462**|Disables log stream compression for asynchronous availability groups. This feature is enabled by default on asynchronous availability groups in order to optimize network bandwidth. For more information, see [Tune compression for availability group](../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/tune-compression-for-availability-group.md).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only| 
|**1800**|Enables [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] optimization when disks of different sector sizes are used for primary and secondary replica log files, in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] AG and Log Shipping environments. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3009974).<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|
|**2301**|Enable advanced decision support optimizations. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920093).<br /><br />**Scope**: global and session and query|
|**2312**|Enables you to set the query optimizer cardinality estimation model to the [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] versions, dependent of the compatibility level of the database. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2801413).<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query| 
|**2335**|Causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to assume a fixed amount of memory is available during query optimization. It does not limit the memory [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] grants to execute the query. The memory configured for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will still be used by data cache, query execution and other consumers. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2413549).<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**2340**|Causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] not to use a sort operation (batch sort) for optimized nested loop joins when generating a plan. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2009160).<br /><br />Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1, to accomplish this at the query level, add the **USE HINT** [query hint](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query.md) instead of using this trace flag.<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**2371**|Changes the fixed auto update statistics threshold to dynamic auto update statistics threshold. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2754171).<br /><br />**Note:** Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] this behavior is controlled by the engine and trace flag 2371 has no effect.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**2389**|Enable automatically generated quick statistics for ascending keys (histogram amendment). If trace flag 2389 is set, and a leading statistics column is marked as ascending, then the histogram used to estimate cardinality will be adjusted at query compile time. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2801413).<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**2390**|Enable automatically generated quick statistics for ascending or unknown keys (histogram amendment). If trace flag 2390 is set, and a leading statistics column is marked as ascending or unknown, then the histogram used to estimate cardinality will be adjusted at query compile time. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2801413).<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**2453**|Allows a table variable to trigger recompile when enough number of rows are changed. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2952444).<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**2528**|Disables parallel checking of objects by DBCC CHECKDB, DBCC CHECKFILEGROUP, and DBCC CHECKTABLE. By default, the degree of parallelism is automatically determined by the query processor. The maximum degree of parallelism is configured just like that of parallel queries. For more information, see [Configure the max degree of parallelism Server Configuration Option](../../database-engine/configure/windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option.md).<br /><br />Parallel DBCC should typically be left enabled. For DBCC CHECKDB, the query processor reevaluates and automatically adjusts parallelism with each table or batch of tables checked. Sometimes, checking may start when the server is almost idle. An administrator who knows that the load will increase before checking is complete may want to manually decrease or disable parallelism.<br /><br />Disabling parallel checking of DBCC can cause DBCC to take much longer to complete and if DBCC is run with the TABLOCK feature enabled and parallelism set off, tables may be locked for longer periods of time.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|
|**2549**|Runs the DBCC CHECKDB command assuming each database file is on a unique disk drive. DBCC CHECKDB command builds an internal list of pages to read per unique disk drive across all database files. This logic determines unique disk drives based on the drive letter of the physical file name of each file.<br /><br />**Note:** Do not use this trace flag unless you know that each file is based on a unique physical disk.<br /><br />**Note:** Although this trace flag improve the performance of the DBCC CHECKDB commands which target usage of the **PHYSICAL_ONLY** option, some users may not see any improvement in performance. While this trace flag improves disk I/O resources usage, the underlying performance of disk resources may limit the overall performance of the DBCC CHECKDB command. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2634571).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only| 
|**2562**|Runs the DBCC CHECKDB command in a single "batch" regardless of the number of indexes in the database. By default, the DBCC CHECKDB command tries to minimize tempdb resources by limiting the number of indexes or "facts" that it generates by using a "batches" concept. This trace flag forces all processing into one batch.<br /><br />One effect of using this trace flag is that the space requirements for tempdb may increase. Tempdb may grow to as much as 5% or more of the user database that is being processed by the DBCC CHECKDB command.<br /><br />**Note:** Although this trace flag improve the performance of the DBCC CHECKDB commands which target usage of the **PHYSICAL_ONLY** option, some users may not see any improvement in performance. While this trace flag improves disk I/O resources usage, the underlying performance of disk resources may limit the overall performance of the DBCC CHECKDB command. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2634571).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**2566**|Runs the DBCC CHECKDB command without data purity check unless DATA_PURITY option is specified.<br /><br />**Note:** Column-value integrity checks are enabled by default and do not require the DATA_PURITY option. For databases upgraded from earlier versions of SQL Server, column-value checks are not enabled by default until DBCC CHECKDB WITH DATA_PURITY has been run error free on the database at least once. After this, DBCC CHECKDB checks column-value integrity by default. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/945770).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**3023**|Enables CHECKSUM option as default for BACKUP command. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2656988).<br /><br />**Note:** Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] this behavior is controlled by setting the **backup checksum default** configuration option. For more information, see [Server Configuration Options &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../database-engine/configure/windows/server-configuration-options-sql-server.md).<br /><br />**Scope**: global and session|
|**3042**|Bypasses the default backup compression pre-allocation algorithm to allow the backup file to grow only as needed to reach its final size. This trace flag is useful if you need to save on space by allocating only the actual size required for the compressed backup. Using this trace flag might cause a slight performance penalty (a possible increase in the duration of the backup operation). For more information about the pre-allocation algorithm, see [Backup Compression &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/backup-compression-sql-server.md).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**3051**|Enables SQL Server Backup to URL logging to a specific error log file. For more information, see [SQL Server Backup to URL Best Practices and Troubleshooting](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/sql-server-backup-to-url-best-practices-and-troubleshooting.md).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|  
|**3205**|By default, if a tape drive supports hardware compression, either the DUMP or BACKUP statement uses it. With this trace flag, you can disable hardware compression for tape drivers. This is useful when you want to exchange tapes with other sites or tape drives that do not support compression.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|  
|**3226**|By default, every successful backup operation adds an entry in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log and in the system event log. If you create very frequent log backups, these success messages accumulate quickly, resulting in huge error logs in which finding other messages is problematic.<br /><br />With this trace flag, you can suppress these log entries. This is useful if you are running frequent log backups and if none of your scripts depend on those entries.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|   
|**3608**|Prevents [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] from automatically starting and recovering any database except the **master** database. If activities that require **tempdb** are initiated, then **model** is recovered and **tempdb** is created. Other databases will be started and recovered when accessed. Some features, such as snapshot isolation and read committed snapshot, might not work. Use for [Move System Databases](../../relational-databases/databases/move-system-databases.md) and [Move User Databases](../../relational-databases/databases/move-user-databases.md).<br /><br />**Note:** Do not use during normal operation.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|   
|**3625**|Limits the amount of information returned to users who are not members of the sysadmin fixed server role, by masking the parameters of some error messages using '\*\*\*\*\*\*'. This can help prevent disclosure of sensitive information.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|  
|**4136**|Disables parameter sniffing unless **OPTION(RECOMPILE)**, **WITH RECOMPILE** or **OPTIMIZE FOR value** is used. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980653). To accomplish this at the database level, see [ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md). To accomplish this at the query level, add the **OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN** [query hint](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query.md). Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1, a second option to accomplish this at the query level is to add the **USE HINT** [query hint](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query.md) instead of using this trace flag.<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|  
|**4137**|Causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to generate a plan using minimum selectivity when estimating AND predicates for filters to account for correlation, under the query optimizer cardinality estimation model of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] and earlier versions. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2658214).<br /><br />Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1, to accomplish this at the query level, add the **USE HINT** [query hint](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query.md) instead of using this trace flag.<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query| 
|**4138**|Causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to generate a plan that does not use row goal adjustments with queries that contain TOP, OPTION (FAST N), IN, or EXISTS keywords. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2667211).<br /><br />Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1, to accomplish this at the query level, add the **USE HINT** [query hint](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query.md) instead of using this trace flag.<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query| 
|**4139**|Enable automatically generated quick statistics (histogram amendment) regardless of key column status. If trace flag 4139 is set, regardless of the leading statistics column status (ascending, descending, or stationary), the histogram used to estimate cardinality will be adjusted at query compile time. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2952101).<br /><br />Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1, to accomplish this at the query level, add the **USE HINT** [query hint](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query.md) instead of using this trace flag.<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**4199**|Controls query optimizer changes released in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Cumulative Updates and Service Packs. Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)], trace flag 4199 changes that are made to previous releases of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will become enabled under database [compatibility level](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level.md) 130 without trace flag 4199 enabled. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/974006).<br /><br />To enable this at the database level, see [ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)], customers are advised to remove trace flag 4199 after they migrate their databases to the latest compatibility level because trace flag 4199 will be reused for future query optimizer changes that may not apply to your application and could cause unexpected plan performance changes on a production system. This means that different trace flag 4199 changes are enabled for each compatibility level that is supported in a given product release.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**4610**|Increases the size of the hash table that stores the cache entries by a factor of 8. When used together with trace flag 4618 increases the number of entries in the TokenAndPermUserStore cache store to 8,192. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/959823).<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|
|**4616**|Makes server-level metadata visible to application roles. In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], an application role cannot access metadata outside its own database because application roles are not associated with a server-level principal. This is a change of behavior from earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Setting this global flag disables the new restrictions, and allows for application roles to access server-level metadata.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**4618**|Limits the number of entries in the TokenAndPermUserStore cache store to 1,024. When used together with trace flag 4610 increases the number of entries in the TokenAndPermUserStore cache store to 8,192.

|**6498**|Enables more than one large query compilation to gain access to the big gateway when there is sufficient memory available. It is based on the 80 percentage of SQL Server Target Memory, and it allows for one large query compilation per 25 gigabytes (GB) of memory. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3024815).<br /><br />**Note:** Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] SP2 and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] this behavior is controlled by the engine and trace flag 6498 has no effect.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**6527**|Disables generation of a memory dump on the first occurrence of an out-of-memory exception in CLR integration. By default, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] generates a small memory dump on the first occurrence of an out-of-memory exception in the CLR. The behavior of the trace flag is as follows:<br /><br />-   If this is used as a startup trace flag, a memory dump is never generated. However, a memory dump may be generated if other trace flags are used.<br />-   If this trace flag is enabled on a running server, a memory dump will not be automatically generated from that point on. However, if a memory dump has already been generated due to an out-of-memory exception in the CLR, this trace flag will have no effect.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|

## Remarks  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], there are three types of trace flags: query, session and global. Query trace flags are active for the context of a specific query. Session trace flags are active for a connection and are visible only to that connection. Global trace flags are set at the server level and are visible to every connection on the server. Some flags can only be enabled as global, and some can be enabled at either global or session scope.  
  
 The following rules apply:  
  
-   A global trace flag must be enabled globally. Otherwise, the trace flag has no effect. We recommend that you enable global trace flags at startup, by using the **-T** command line option. This ensures the trace flag remains active after a server restart.  
  
-   If a trace flag has either global, session or query scope, it can be enabled with the appropriate scope. A trace flag that is enabled at the session level never affects another session, and the effect of the trace flag is lost when the SPID that opened the session logs out.  
  
 Trace flags are set on or off by using either of the following methods:  
  
-   Using the DBCC TRACEON and DBCC TRACEOFF commands.  
  
     For example, DBCC TRACEON 2528: To enable the trace flag globally, use DBCC TRACEON with the -1 argument: `DBCC TRACEON (2528, -1)`. The effect of enabling a global trace flag with DBCC TRACEON is lost on server restart. To turn off a global trace flag, use DBCC TRACEOFF with the -1 argument.  
  
-   Using the **-T** startup option to specify that the trace flag be set on during startup.  
  
     The **-T** startup option enables a trace flag globally. You cannot enable a session-level trace flag by using a startup option. This ensures the trace flag remains active after a server restart. For more information about startup options, see [Database Engine Service Startup Options](../../database-engine/configure/windows/database-engine-service-startup-options.md).
     
-   At the query level, by using the **QUERYTRACEON** [query hint](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2801413).
  
 Use the DBCC TRACESTATUS command to determine which trace flags are currently active.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example sets trace flag 3205 on for all sessions at the server level by using DBCC TRACEON.  
  
```  
DBCC TRACEON (3205,-1);  
```

You can enable all plan-affecting hotfixes controlled by trace flags 4199 and 4137 for a particular query.
  
``` 
SELECT x FROM correlated WHERE f1 = 0 AND f2 = 1 OPTION (QUERYTRACEON 4199, QUERYTRACEON 4137)
```
