# Manage Subscription Owners and Run Subscription - PowerShell
[!INCLUDE[feedback_stackoverflow_msdn_connect_md](../../integration-services/includes/feedback-stackoverflow-msdn-connect-md.md)]

  Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] you can programmatically transfer the ownership of a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] subscription from one user to another. This topic provides several Windows PowerShell scripts you can use to change or simply list subscription ownership. Each sample includes sample syntax for both Native mode and SharePoint mode. After you change the subscription owner, the subscription will then execute in the security context of the new owner, and the User!UserID field in the report will display the value of new owner. For more information on the object model the PowerShell samples call, see <xref:ReportService2010.ReportingService2010.ChangeSubscriptionOwner%2A>

### Permissions  
 This section summarizes the permission levels required to use each of the methods for both Native and SharePoint mode [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. The scripts in this topic use the following [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] methods:  
  
-   [ReportingService2010.ListSubscriptions Method](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/reportservice2010.reportingservice2010.listsubscriptions.aspx)  
  
-   [ReportingService2010.ChangeSubscriptionOwner Method](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/reportservice2010.reportingservice2010.changesubscriptionowner.aspx)  
  
-   [ReportingService2010.ListChildren](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/reportservice2010.reportingservice2010.listchildren.aspx)  
  
-   The method [ReportingService2010.FireEvent](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/reportservice2010.reportingservice2010.fireevent.aspx) is only used in the last script to trigger a specific subscription to run. If you do not plan to use that script you can ignore the permission requirements for the FireEvent method.  
  
 **Native mode:**  
  
-   List Subscriptions: [ReportOperation Enumeration](ReportOperation%20Enumeration.xml) on the report AND the user is the subscription owner) OR ReadAnySubscription.  
  
-   Change Subscriptions: The user must be a member of the BUILTIN\Administrators group  
  
-   List Children: ReadProperties on Item  
  
-   Fire Event: GenerateEvents (System)  
  
 **SharePoint mode:**  
  
-   List Subscriptions: ManageAlerts OR [CreateAlerts](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spbasepermissions.aspx) on the report AND the user is the subscription owner and the subscription is a timed subscription).  
  
-   Change Subscriptions: ManageWeb  
  
-   List Children: ViewListItems  
  
-   Fire Event: ManageWeb  
  
 For more information, see [Compare Roles and Tasks in Reporting Services to SharePoint Groups and Permissions](../../reporting-services/security/reporting-services-roles-tasks-vs.-sharepoint-groups-permissions.md).  
  
### Script usage  
 **Create Script files (.ps1)**  
  
1.  Create a folder named **c:\scripts**. If you choose a different folder then modify the folder name used in the example command line syntax statements.  
  
2.  Create a text file for each script and save the files to the c:\scripts folder. When you create the .ps1 files, use the name from each example command line syntax.  
  
3.  Open a command prompt with administrative privileges.  
  
4.  Run each script file, using the sample command line syntax provided with each example.  
  
 **Tested environments**  
  
 The scripts in this topic were tested on PowerShell version 3 and with the following versions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)]  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_list_ownership_all"></a> Script: List the ownership of all subscriptions  
 This script lists all of the subscriptions on a site. You can use this script to test your connection or to verify the report path and subscription id for use in the other scripts. This is also a useful script to simply audit what subscriptions exist and who owns them.  
  
 **Native mode syntax:**  
  
```  
powershell c:\scripts\ListAll_SSRS_Subscriptions.ps1 "[server]/reportserver" "/"  
```  
  
 **SharePoint mode syntax:**  
  
```  
powershell c:\scripts\ListAll_SSRS_Subscriptions.ps1 "[server]/_vti_bin/reportserver" "http://[server]"  
```  
  
 **Script:**  
  
```  
# Parameters  
#    server   - server and instance name (e.g. myserver/reportserver or myserver/reportserver_db2)  
  
Param(  
    [string]$server,  
    [string]$site  
   )  
  
$rs2010 += New-WebServiceProxy -Uri "http://$server/ReportService2010.asmx" -Namespace SSRS.ReportingService2010 -UseDefaultCredential ;  
$subscriptions += $rs2010.ListSubscriptions($site); # use "/" for default native mode site  
  
Write-Host " "  
Write-Host "----- $server's Subscriptions: "  
$subscriptions | select Path, report, Description, Owner, SubscriptionID, lastexecuted, Status  
```  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  To verify site URLS in SharePoint mode, use the SharePoint cmdlet **Get-SPSite**. For more information, see [Get-SPSite](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff607950\(v=office.15\).aspx).  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_list_all_one_user"></a> Script: List all subscriptions owned by a specific user  
 This script lists all of the subscriptions owned by a specific user. You can use this script to test your connection or to verify the report path and subscription id for use in the other scripts. This script is useful when someone in your organization leaves and you want to verify what subscriptions they owned so you can change the owner or delete the subscription.  
  
 **Native mode syntax:**  
  
```  
powershell c:\scripts\ListAll_SSRS_Subscriptions4User.ps1 "[Domain]\[user]" "[server]/reportserver" "/"  
```  
  
 **SharePoint mode syntax:**  
  
```  
powershell c:\scripts\ListAll_SSRS_Subscriptions4User.ps1 "[Domain]\[user]"  "[server]/_vti_bin/reportserver" "http://[server]"

```  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_change_all"></a> Script: Change ownership for all subscriptions owned by a specific user  
 This script changes the ownership for all subscriptions owned by a specific user to the new owner parameter.  
  
 **Native mode syntax:**

Param(  
    [string]$currentOwner,  
    [string]$newOwner,  
    [string]$server  
)  
  
$rs2010 = New-WebServiceProxy -Uri "http://$server/ReportService2010.asmx" -Namespace SSRS.ReportingService2010 -UseDefaultCredential ;

    }  
}  
```  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_list_for_1_report"></a> Script: List all subscriptions associated with a specific report  
 This script lists all of the subscriptions associated with a specific report. The report path syntax is different SharePoint mode which requires a full URL. In the syntax examples, the report name used is “title only”, which contains a space and therefore requires the single quotes around the report name.  
  
 **Native mode syntax:**  
  
```  
powershell c:\scripts\List_SSRS_One_Reports_Subscriptions.ps1 "[server]/reportserver" "'/reports/title only'" "/"  
```  
  
 **SharePoint mode syntax:**  
  
```  
powershell c:\scripts\List_SSRS_One_Reports_Subscriptions.ps1 "[server]/_vti_bin/reportserver"  "'http://[server]/shared documents/title only.rdl'" "http://[server]"  
```  
  
 **Script:**  
  
```  
# Parameters:  
#    server      - server and instance name (e.g. myserver/reportserver or myserver/reportserver_db2)  
#    reportpath  - path to report in the report server, including report name e.g. /reports/test report >> pass in  "'/reports/title only'"  
#    site        - use "/" for default native mode site  
Param  
(  
      [string]$server,  
      [string]$reportpath,  
      [string]$site  
)  
  
$rs2010 = New-WebServiceProxy -Uri "http://$server/ReportService2010.asmx" -Namespace SSRS.ReportingService2010 -UseDefaultCredential ;  
$subscriptions += $rs2010.ListSubscriptions($site);  
  
Write-Host " "  
Write-Host " "  
Write-Host "----- $reportpath 's Subscriptions: "  
$subscriptions | select Path, report, Description, Owner, SubscriptionID, lastexecuted,Status | where {$_.path -eq $reportpath}  
```  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_change_all_1_subscription"></a> Script: Change ownership of a specific subscription  
 This script changes the ownership for a specific subscription. The subscription is identified by the SubscriptionID that you pass into the script. You can use one of the list subscription scripts to determine the correct SubscriptionID.  
  
 **Native mode syntax:**  
  
```  
powershell c:\scripts\Change_SSRS_Owner_One_Subscription.ps1 "[Domain]\[new owner]" "[server]/reportserver" "/" "ac5637a1-9982-4d89-9d69-a72a9c3b3150"  
```  
  
 **SharePoint mode syntax:**  
  
```  
powershell c:\scripts\Change_SSRS_Owner_One_Subscription.ps1 "[Domain]\[new owner]" "[server]/_vti_bin/reportserver" "http://[server]" "9660674b-f020-453f-b1e3-d9ba37624519"  
```  
  
 **Script:**  
  
```  
# Parameters:  
#    newOwner       - DOMAIN\USER that will own the subscriptions you wish to change  
#    server         - server and instance name (e.g. myserver/reportserver or myserver/reportserver_db2)  
#    site        - use "/" for default native mode site  
#    subscriptionID - guid for the single subscription to change  
  
Param(  
    [string]$newOwner,  
    [string]$server,  
    [string]$site,  
    [string]$subscriptionid  
   )  
$rs2010 = New-WebServiceProxy -Uri "http://$server/ReportService2010.asmx" -Namespace SSRS.ReportingService2010 -UseDefaultCredential;  
  
$subscription += $rs2010.ListSubscriptions($site) | where {$_.SubscriptionID -eq $subscriptionid};  
  
Write-Host " "  
Write-Host "----- $subscriptionid's Subscription properties: "  
$subscription | select Path, report, Description, SubscriptionID, Owner, Status  
  
$rs2010.ChangeSubscriptionOwner($subscription.SubscriptionID, $newOwner)  
  
#refresh the list  
$subscription = $rs2010.ListSubscriptions($site) | where {$_.SubscriptionID -eq $subscriptionid}; # use "/" for default native mode site  
Write-Host "----- $subscriptionid's Subscription properties: "  
$subscription | select Path, report, Description, SubscriptionID, Owner, Status  
```  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_run_1_subscription"></a> Script: Run (fire) a single subscription  
 This script will run a specific subscription using the FireEvent method. The script will immediately run the subscription regardless of the schedule configured for the subscription. The EventType is matched against the known set of events that are defined in the report server configuration file **rsreportserver.config** The script uses the following event type for standard subscriptions:  
  
 `<Event>`  
  
 `<Type>TimedSubscription</Type>`  
  
 `</Event>`  
  
 For more information on the configuration file, see [RsReportServer.config Configuration File](../../reporting-services/report-server/rsreportserver.config-configuration-file.md).  
  
 The script includes delay logic “`Start-Sleep -s 6`” so there is time after the event fires, for the updated status to be available with the ListSubscription method.  
  
 **Native mode syntax:**  
  
```  
powershell c:\scripts\FireSubscription.ps1 "[server]/reportserver" $null "70366e82-2d3c-4edd-a216-b97e51e26de9"  
```  
  
 **SharePoint mode syntax:**  
  
```  
powershell c:\scripts\FireSubscription.ps1 "[server]/_vti_bin/reportserver" "http://[server]" "c3425c72-580d-423e-805a-41cf9799fd25"  
```  
  
 **Script:**  
  
```  
  
# Parameters  
#    server         - server and instance name (e.g. myserver/reportserver or myserver/reportserver_db2)  
#    site           - use $null for a native mode server  
#    subscriptionid - subscription guid  
  
Param(  
  [string]$server,  
  [string]$site,  
  [string]$subscriptionid  
  )  
  
$rs2010 = New-WebServiceProxy -Uri "http://$server/ReportService2010.asmx" -Namespace SSRS.ReportingService2010 -UseDefaultCredential ;  
#event type is case sensative to what is in the rsreportserver.config  
$rs2010.FireEvent("TimedSubscription",$subscriptionid,$site)  
  
Write-Host " "  
Write-Host "----- Subscription ($subscriptionid) status: "  
#get list of subscriptions and filter to the specific ID to see the Status and LastExecuted  
Start-Sleep -s 6 # slight delay in processing so ListSubscription returns the updated Status and LastExecuted  
$subscriptions = $rs2010.ListSubscriptions($site);   
$subscriptions | select Status, Path, report, Description, Owner, SubscriptionID, EventType, lastexecuted | where {$_.SubscriptionID -eq $subscriptionid}  
  
```
