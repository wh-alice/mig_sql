# Value (MDX)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns the value of the current member of the Measures dimension that intersects with the current member of the attribute hierarchies in the context of the query.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Member_Expression[.Value]   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Member_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a member.  
  
## Remarks  
 The **Value** function returns the value of the specified member as a string. The **Value** argument is optional because the value of a member is the default property of a member, and is value that is returned for a member if no other value is specified. For more information about properties of members, see [Intrinsic Member Properties &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/Intrinsic%20Member%20Properties%20\(MDX\).md) and [User-Defined Member Properties &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/User-Defined%20Member%20Properties%20\(MDX\).md).  
  
## Examples  
 The following example returns the value of a member as well explicitly returning the name of the member.  
  
```  
WITH MEMBER [Date].[Calendar].NumericValue as [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2001].Value  
MEMBER [Date].[Calendar].MemberName AS [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2001].Name  
  
SELECT {[Date].[Calendar].NumericValue, [Date].[Calendar].MemberName} ON 0  
from [Adventure Works]  
```  
  
 The following example returns the value of a member, as the default value that is returned for a member on an axis.  
  
```  
SELECT {[Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2001]} ON 0  
from [Adventure Works]  
```
