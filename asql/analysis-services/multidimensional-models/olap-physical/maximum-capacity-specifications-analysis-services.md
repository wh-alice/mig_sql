# Maximum Capacity Specifications (Analysis Services)
  The following tables specify the maximum sizes and numbers of various objects defined in [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] components under different server deployment modes.  
  
 This topic contains the following sections:  
  
 [Multidimensional and Data Mining (DeploymentMode=0)](#bkmk_OLAP)  
  
 [SharePoint (DeploymentMode=1)](#bkmk_sharepoint)  
  
 [Tabular (DeploymentMode=2)](#bkmk_vertipaq)  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_OLAP"></a> Multidimensional and Data Mining (DeploymentMode=0)  
 MOLAP storage mode, which stores both data and metadata, has additional physical limits on file sizes. String store files are a maximum size of 4 GB by default. If you require larger files for string stores, you can specify a different string storage architecture. For more information, see [Configure String Storage for Dimensions and Partitions](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/configure-string-storage-for-dimensions-and-partitions.md).
