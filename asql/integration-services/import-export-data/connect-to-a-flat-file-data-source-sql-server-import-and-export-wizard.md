# Connect to a Flat File Data Source (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
This topic shows you how to connect to a **flat file** (text file) data source from the **Choose a Data Source** or **Choose a Destination** page of the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard. For flat files, these two pages of the wizard present different sets of options, so this topic describes the flat file source and destination separately.

## Connect to a flat file source
 
 There are four pages of options for flat file data sources. That's a lot of pages! But you don't have to spend a lot of time on each page. Here are the tasks to consider.
 
Page|Recommendation  |Type  
----|---------|---------
**General**|Make sure you update the options in the **Format** section.|Recommended    
**Columns**|Make sure you check the column and row delimiters (for a Delimited file) or mark the columns (for a Fixed Width file).|Recommended
**Advanced**|Optionally, check the data types and other properties assigned by default to the columns.|Optional
**Preview**|Optionally, preview a sample of the data, using the settings that you specified.|Optional

## General page (source)
 On the **General** page, browse to select the file, then verify the settings in the **Format** section.

### Options to specify (**General** page)

 **File name**  
 Enter the path and file name of the flat file.  
  
 **Browse**  
 Locate the flat file.  
  
 **Locale**  
 Specify the locale to provide language-specific information for sorting and for date and time formats.  
  
 **Unicode**  
 Specify whether the file uses Unicode. If you use Unicode, you can't specify a code page.  
  
 **Code page**  
 Specify the code page for non-Unicode text.  
  
 **Format**  
 Select whether the file uses delimited, fixed width, or ragged right formatting.

|Delimited|Columns are separated by delimiters. You specify the delimiter on the **Columns** page.|  
|Fixed width|Columns have a fixed width.|  
|Ragged right|Ragged right files are files in which every column has a fixed width, except for the last column, which is delimited by the row delimiter.|  
  
 **Text qualifier**  
 Specify the text qualifier, if any, used by the file. For example, you can specify that text fields are enclosed in quotation marks. (This property only applies to Delimited files.) 
  
> [!NOTE]
> After you select a text qualifier, you can't re-select the **None** option. Type **None** to de-select the text qualifier.  
  
 **Header row delimiter**  
 Select from the list of delimiters for header rows, or enter the delimiter text.

In the screen shot, note that the **id** column, which contains numbers, initially has a data type of string.

### Options to specify (**Advanced** page)

 **Configure the properties of each column**  
 Select a column in the left pane to view its properties in the right pane. See the following table for a description of column properties. Some of the properties listed are configurable only for certain flat file formats and for columns of certain data types.  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**Name**|Provide a descriptive column name. If you do not enter a name, [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] automatically creates a name in the format Column 0, Column 1 and so forth.|
|**ColumnDelimiter**|Select from the list of available column delimiters. Choose delimiters that are not likely to occur in the text. This value is ignored for fixed-width columns.<br /><br /> **{CR}{LF}**. Columns are delimited by a carriage return-line feed combination.<br /><br /> **{CR}**. Columns are delimited by a carriage return.<br /><br /> **{LF}**. Columns are delimited by a line feed.<br /><br /> **Semicolon {;}**. Columns are delimited by a semicolon.<br /><br /> **Colon {:}**. Columns are delimited by a colon.<br /><br /> **Comma {,}**. Columns are delimited by a comma.<br /><br /> **Tab {t}**. Columns are delimited by a tab.<br /><br /> **Vertical bar {&#124;}**. Columns are delimited by a vertical bar.|
|**ColumnType**|Denotes whether the column is delimited, fixed width, or ragged right. This property is read-only. Ragged right files are files in which every column has a fixed width, except for the last column. It is delimited by the row delimiter.|  
|**InputColumnWidth**|Specify a value to be stored as a count of bytes; for Unicode files, this will display as a count of characters. This value is ignored for delimited columns.<br /><br /> **Note** In the object model, the name of this property is ColumnWidth.|
|**DataPrecision**|Specify the precision of numeric data. Precision refers to the number of digits.|
|**DataScale**|Specify the scale of numeric data. Scale refers to the number of decimal places.|
|**DataType**|Select from the list of available data types.<br/>For more information, see [Integration Services Data Types](../../integration-services/data-flow/integration-services-data-types.md).|
|**OutputColumnWidth**|Specify a value to be stored as a count of bytes; for Unicode files, this value corresponds to a count of characters. In the Data Flow task, this value is used to set the output column width for the Flat File source. In the object model, the name of this property is MaximumWidth.|  
|**TextQualified**|Indicate whether text data is surrounded by text qualifier characters such as quote characters.<br /><br /> True: Text data in the flat file is qualified. False: Text data in the flat file is NOT qualified.|  
  
**New**  
 Add a new column by clicking **New**. By default, the **New** button adds a new column at the end of the list. The button also has the following options, available in the drop-down list.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Add Column**|Add a new column at the end of the list.|  
|**Insert Before**|Insert a new column before the selected column.|

 **Delete**  
 Select a column, and then remove it by clicking **Delete**.  
  
 **Suggest Types**  
 Use the **Suggest Column Types** dialog box to evaluate sample data in the file and to obtain suggestions for the data type and length of each column.  
 
Click **Suggest types** to display the **Suggest Column Types** dialog box. 

![Flat file connection suggest](../../integration-services/import-export-data/media/flat-file-connection-suggest.png)

After you choose options in the **Suggest Column Types** dialog box and click **OK**, the wizard may change the data types of some of the columns.

The following screen shot shows that, after you click **Suggest types**, the wizard has recognized that the **id** column in the data source is in fact a number and not a text string, and has changed the data type of the column from a string to an integer.

![Flat file connection advanced after](../../integration-services/import-export-data/media/flat-file-connection-advanced-after.png)
