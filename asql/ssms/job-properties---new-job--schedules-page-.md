# Job Properties - New Job (Schedules Page)
Use this page to view and organize schedules for a Microsoft SQL Server Agent job.  
  
## Options  
**Schedule list**  
Lists the schedules for this job.  
  
**New**  
Create a new schedule. After you create the schedule, the schedule is added to the job.  
  
**Pick**  
Select a schedule from the existing schedules. Because a job and schedule must have the same owner, this option will only allow you to pick from schedules that you own.  
  
**Edit**  
Edit the selected schedule to change job schedule properties.  
  
**Remove**  
Remove the selected schedule from the job. If no other jobs use the schedule, the schedule is deleted from the database.
