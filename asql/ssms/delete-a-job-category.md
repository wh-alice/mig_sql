# Delete a Job Category
This topic describes how to delete a Microsoft SQL Server Agent job category in SQL Server 2016 by using SQL Server Management Studio, Transact-SQL or SQL Server Management Objects.  
  
Job categories help you organize your jobs for easy filtering and grouping. For example, you can organize all your database backup jobs in the Database Maintenance category.
