# suspect_pages (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Contains one row per page that failed with a minor [823 error](../Topic/MSSQLSERVER_823.md) or an [824 error](../Topic/MSSQLSERVER_824.md). Pages are listed in this table because they are suspected of being bad, but they might actually be fine. When a suspect page is repaired, its status is updated in the **event_type** column.  
  
 The following table, which has a limit of 1,000 rows, is stored in the **msdb** database.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**database_id**|**int**|ID of the database to which this page applies.|  
|**file_id**|**int**|ID of the file in the database.|  
|**page_id**|**bigint**|ID of the suspect page. Every page has a page ID that is a 32-bit value identifying the location of the page in the database. The **page_id** is the offset into the data file of the 8 KB page. Each page ID is unique in a file.|  
|**event_type**|**int**|The type of error; one of:<br /><br /> 1 = An 823 error that causes a suspect page (such as a disk error) or an 824 error other than a bad checksum or a torn page (such as a bad page ID).<br /><br /> 2 = Bad checksum.<br /><br /> 3 = Torn page.<br /><br /> 4 = Restored (page was restored after it was marked bad).<br /><br /> 5 = Repaired (DBCC repaired the page).<br /><br /> 7 = Deallocated by DBCC.|  
|**error_count**|**int**|Number of times the error has occurred.|  
|**last_update_date**|**datetime**|Date-and-time stamp of the last update.|
