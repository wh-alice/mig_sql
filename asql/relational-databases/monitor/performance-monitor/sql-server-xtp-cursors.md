# SQL Server XTP Cursors
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  The SQL Server XTP Cursors performance object contains counters related to internal In-Memory OLTP engine cursors. Cursors are the low-level building blocks the In-Memory OLTP engine uses to process [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] queries. As such, you do not typically have direct control over them.  
  
 This table describes the **SQL Server XTP Cursors** counters.  
  
|Counter|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|**Cursor deletes/sec**|The number of cursor deletes (on average), per second.|  
|**Cursor inserts/sec**|The number of cursor inserts (on average), per second.|  
|**Cursor scans started /sec**|The number of cursor scans started (on average), per second.|  
|**Cursor unique violations/sec**|The number of unique-constraint violations (on average), per second.|  
|**Cursor updates/sec**|The number of cursor updates (on average), per second.|  
|**Cursor write   conflicts/sec**|The number of write-write conflicts to the same row version (on average), per second.|  
|**Dusty corner scan retries/sec (user-issued)**|The number of scan retries due to write conflicts during dusty corner sweeps issued by a user's full-table scan (on average), per second. This is a very low-level counter, not intended for customer use.|  
|**Expired rows removed/sec**|The number of expired rows removed by cursors (on average), per second.|  
|**Expired rows touched/sec**|The number of expired rows touched by cursors (on average), per second.|  
|**Rows returned/sec**|The number of rows returned by cursors (on average), per second.|  
|**Rows touched/sec**|The number of rows touched by cursors (on average), per second.|  
|**Tentatively-deleted rows touched/sec**|The number of expiring rows touched by cursors (on average), per second. A row is expiring if the transaction that deleted it is still active (i.e. has not yet committed or aborted.)|
