# Removing SSMA for DB2 Components (DB2ToSQL)
When you have finished migrating databases from DB2 to SQL Server, you might want to uninstall SSMA components. You can uninstall the client components at any time. However, you should not uninstall the extension pack from SQL Server unless your migrated databases no longer use functions in the **ssma_DB2** schema of the **sysdb** database.  
  
## Uninstalling the SSMA for DB2 Client  
You can uninstall SSMA by using **Add or Remove Programs**.  
  
**To uninstall SSMA**  
  
1.  In Control Panel, open **Add or Remove Programs**.  
  
2.  Select **MicrosoftSQL Server Migration Assistant for DB2**, and then click **Remove**.  
  
3.  To confirm that you want to uninstall SSMA, click **Yes**.  
  
## Uninstalling the Extension Pack  
If you are sure your migrated databases do not use objects in the **sysdb.ssma_DB2** schema, you can remove the extension pack by deleting it from the schema â€“ there are is no Windows uninstall
