# STDifference (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns an object that represents the point set from one **geography** instance that lies outside another **geography** instance.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STDifference ( other_geography )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *other_geography*  
 Is another **geography** instance indicating which points to remove from the instance on which STDifference() is being invoked.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **geography**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlGeography**  
  
## Exceptions  
 This method throws an **ArgumentException** if the instance contains an antipodal edge.  
  
## Remarks  
 This method always returns null if the spatial reference identifiers (SRIDs) of the **geography** instances do not match.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the set of possible results returned on the server has been extended to **FullGlobe** instances. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports spatial instances that are larger than a hemisphere. The result may contain circular arc segments only if the input instances contain circular arc segments. This method is not precise.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Computing the difference between two geography instances  
 The following example uses `STDifference()` to compute the difference between two **geography** instances.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geography;  
DECLARE @h geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((-122.358 47.653, -122.348 47.649, -122.348 47.658, -122.358 47.658, -122.358 47.653))', 4326);  
SET @h = geography::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656)', 4326);  
SELECT @g.STDifference(@h).ToString();  
```  
  
### B. Using a FullGlobe with STDifference()  
 The following example uses `FullGlobe` instance. The first result is an empty `GeometryCollection` and the second result is a `Polygon` instance. `STDifference()` returns an empty `GeometryCollection` when a `FullGlobe` instance is the parameter. Every point in an invoking `geography` instance is contained in a `FullGlobe` instance.  
  
 `DECLARE @g geography = 'POLYGON((-122.358 47.653, -122.348 47.649, -122.348 47.658, -122.358 47.658, -122.358 47.653))';`  
  
 `DECLARE @h geography = 'FULLGLOBE';`  
  
 `SELECT @g.STDifference(@h).ToString(),`  
  
 `@h.STDifference(@g).ToString();`
