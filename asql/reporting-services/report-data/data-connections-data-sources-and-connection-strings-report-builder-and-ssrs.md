# Data Connections, Data Sources, and Connection Strings (Report Builder and SSRS)
  To include data in [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/ssrbnoversion-md.md)] and  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] paginated reports, you must first create *data sources* and *datasets*. This topic explains the type of data sources, how to create data sources, and important information related to data source credentials. A data source includes the data source type, connection information, and the type of credentials to use. There are two types of data sources: embedded and shared. An embedded data source is defined in the report and used only by that report. A shared data source is defined independently from a report and can be used by multiple reports. For more information, see [Embedded and Shared Datasets &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-data/embedded-and-shared-datasets-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).

##  <a name="bkmk_data_sources"></a> Embedded and shared data sources  
 Shared data sources are useful when you have data sources that you use often. It is recommended that you use shared data sources as much as possible. They make reports and report access easier to manage, and help to keep reports and the data sources they access more secure. If you need a shared data source, ask your system administrator to create one for you.  
  
 An embedded data source is a data connection that is saved in the report definition. Embedded data source connection information can be used only by the report in which it is embedded. To define and manage embedded data sources, use the **Data Source Properties** dialog box.  
  
 The difference between the embedded and shared data sources is in how they are created, stored, and managed.  
  
-   In Report Designer, create embedded or shared data sources as part of a [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] project. You can control whether to use them locally for preview or to deploy them as part of the project to a report server or SharePoint site. You can use custom data extensions that have been installed on your computer and on the report server or SharePoint site where you deploy your reports.  
  
     System administrators can install and configure additional data processing extensions and .NET Framework data providers. For more information, see [Data Processing Extensions and .NET Framework Data Providers &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-data/data-processing-extensions-and-.net-framework-data-providers-ssrs.md).  
  
     Developers can use the <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.DataProcessing> API to create data processing extensions to support additional types of data sources.  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/ssrbnoversion-md.md)], browse to a report server or SharePoint site and select shared data sources or create embedded data sources in the report. You cannot create a shared data source in [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/ssrbnoversion-md.md)]. You cannot use custom data extensions in [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/ssrbnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 The following table summarizes the differences between embedded and shared data sources.

 If you fail to connect to a report server using **localhost**, check that the network protocol for TCP/IP protocol is enabled. For more information, see [Configure Client Protocols](../../database-engine/configure/windows/configure-client-protocols.md).  
  
 For more information about the configurations needed to connect to these data source types, see the specific data connection topic under [Add Data from External Data Sources &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-data/add-data-from-external-data-sources-ssrs.md) or [Data Sources Supported by Reporting Services &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-data/data-sources-supported-by-reporting-services-ssrs.md).  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_special_password_characters"></a> Special characters in a password  
 If you configure your ODBC or SQL data source to prompt for a password or to include the password in the connection string, and a user enters the password with special characters like punctuation marks, some underlying data source drivers cannot validate the special characters. When you process the report, the message "Not a valid password" may indicate this problem. If changing the password is impractical, you can work with your database administrator to store the appropriate credentials on the server as part of a system ODBC data source name (DSN). For more information, see "OdbcConnection.ConnectionString" in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] SDK documentation.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_Expressions_in_connection_strings"></a> Expression-based Connection Strings  
 Expression-based connection strings are evaluated at run time. For example, you can specify the data source as a parameter, include the parameter reference in the connection string, and allow the user to choose a data source for the report. For example, suppose a multinational firm has data servers in several countries. With an expression-based connection string, a user who is running a sales report can select a data source for a particular country before running the report.  
  
 The following example illustrates the use of a data source expression in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] connection string. The example assumes you have created a report parameter named `ServerName`:  
  
```  
="data source=" & Parameters!ServerName.Value & ";initial catalog=AdventureWorks"  
```  
  
 Data source expressions are processed at run time or when a report is previewed. The expression must be written in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/vbprvb-md.md)]. Use the following guidelines when defining a data source expression:  
  
-   Design the report using a static connection string. A static connection string refers to a connection string that is not set through an expression (for example, when you follow the steps for creating a report-specific or shared data source, you are defining a static connection string). Using a static connection string allows you to connect to the data source in Report Designer so that you can get the query results you need to create the report.  
  
-   When defining the data source connection, do not use a shared data source. You cannot use a data source expression in a shared data source. You must define an embedded data source for the report.  
  
-   Specify credentials separately from the connection string. You can use stored credentials, prompted credentials, or integrated security.  
  
-   Add a report parameter to specify a data source. For parameter values, you can either provide a static list of available values (in this case, the available values should be data sources you can use with the report) or define a query that retrieves a list of data sources at run time.  
  
-   Be sure that the list of data sources shares the same database schema. All report design begins with schema information. If there is a mismatch between the schema used to define the report and the actual schema used by the report at run time, the report might not run.  
  
-   Before publishing the report, replace the static connection string with an expression. Wait until you are finished designing the report before you replace the static connection string with an expression. Once you use an expression, you cannot execute the query in Report Designer. Furthermore, the field list in the Report Data pane and the Parameters list will not update automatically.
