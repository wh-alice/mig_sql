|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|20572|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|

|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|Subscriber '%s' subscription to article '%s' in publication '%s' has been reinitialized after a validation failure.|  
  
## Explanation  
 The data at the Subscriber was validated against the data at the Publisher, and the data did not match; therefore validation failed. When you specified that validation should be performed, you selected the option that a subscription should be reinitialized if validation failed. Reinitializing a subscription involves applying a new snapshot at the Subscriber. For more information about validation, see [Validate Replicated Data](../../relational-databases/replication/validate-replicated-data.md).  
  
## User Action  
 Data at the Publisher and Subscriber will match after the new snapshot is applied at the Subscriber.
