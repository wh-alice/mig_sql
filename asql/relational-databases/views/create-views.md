# Create Views
  You can create views in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)]. A view can be used for the following purposes:  
  
-   To focus, simplify, and customize the perception each user has of the database.  
  
-   As a security mechanism by allowing users to access data through the view, without granting the users permissions to directly access the underlying base tables.  
  
-   To provide a backward compatible interface to emulate a table whose schema has changed.

    SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.HireDate  
    FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e JOIN Person.Person AS  p  
    ON e.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID ;   
    GO
