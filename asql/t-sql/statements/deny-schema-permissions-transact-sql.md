## Syntax  
  
```  
  
DENY permission  [ ,...n ] } ON SCHEMA :: schema_name  
    TO database_principal [ ,...n ]   
    [ CASCADE ]  
        [ AS denying_principal ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be denied on a schema. For a list of these permissions, see the Remarks section later in this topic.  
  
 ON SCHEMA **::** schema*_name*  
 Specifies the schema on which the permission is being denied. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is being denied. *database_principal* can be one of the following:  
  
-   Database user  
  
-   Database role  
  
-   Application role  
  
-   Database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   Database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   Database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   Database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   Database user not mapped to a server principal  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being denied is also denied to other principals to which it has been granted by this principal.  
  
 *denying_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to deny the permission. *denying_principa*l can be one of the following:  
  
-   Database user  
  
-   Database role  
  
-   Application role  
  
-   Database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   Database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   Database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   Database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   Database user not mapped to a server principal  
  
## Remarks  
 A schema is a database-level securable that is contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on a schema are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Schema permission|Implied by schema permission|Implied by database permission|  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY SCHEMA|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|CREATE SEQUENCE|ALTER|ALTER ANY SCHEMA|  
|DELETE|CONTROL|DELETE|  
|EXECUTE|CONTROL|EXECUTE|  
|INSERT|CONTROL|INSERT|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|SELECT|CONTROL|SELECT|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|UPDATE|CONTROL|UPDATE|  
|VIEW CHANGE TRACKING|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the schema. If you are using the AS option, the specified principal must own the schema.
