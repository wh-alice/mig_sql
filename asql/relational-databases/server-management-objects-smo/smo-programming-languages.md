# SMO Programming Languages
  This section describes how to program [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO) in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual Basic .NET, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual C# .NET, and [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual C++.

 SMO is a .NET assembly. To program by using the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework, you must choose a language that is supported by the common language runtime. In the SMO reference, there is syntax for managed languages such as Visual Basic .NET and Visual C# .NET.
