# sp_repldropcolumn (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Drops a column from an existing table article that has been published. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This stored procedure has been deprecated and is being supported mainly for backward-compatibility. It should only be used with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssversion2000-md.md)] Publishers and [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssversion2000-md.md)] republishing Subscribers. This procedure should not be used on columns with data types that were introduced in [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] or higher.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_repldropcolumn [ @source_object = ] 'source_object', [ @column = ] 'column'   
    [ , [ @from_agent = ] from_agent]   
    [ , [ @schema_change_script = ] 'schema_change_script' ]   
    [ , [ @force_invalidate_snapshot = ] force_invalidate_snapshot ]   
    [ , [ @force_reinit_subscription = ] force_reinit_subscription ]   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ @source_object = ] '*source_object*'  
 Is the name of the table article that contains the column to drop. *source_object* is nvarchar(258), with no default.  
  
 [ @column = ] '*column*'  
 Is the name of the column in the table to be dropped. *column* is sysname, with no default.  
  
 [ @from_agent = ] *from_agent*  
 If the stored procedure is being executed by a replication agent. *from_agent* is int, with a default of 0, where a value of 1 is used when this stored procedure is being executed by a replication agent, and in every other case the default value of 0 should be used.  
  
 [ @schema_change_script = ] '*schema_change_script*'  
 Specifies the name and path of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] script used to modify the system generated custom stored procedures. *schema_change_script* is nvarchar(4000), with a default of NULL. Replication allows user-defined custom stored procedures to replace one or more of the default procedures used in transactional replication. *schema_change_script* is executed after a schema change is made to a replicated table article using sp_repldropcolumn, and can be used to do one of the following:  
  
-   If custom stored procedures are automatically regenerated, *schema_change_script* can be used to drop these custom stored procedures and replace them with user-defined custom stored procedures that supports the new schema.  
  
-   If custom stored procedures are not automatically regenerated, *schema_change_script*can be used to regenerate these stored procedures or to create user-defined custom stored procedures.  
  
 [ @force_invalidate_snapshot = ] *force_invalidate_snapshot*  
 Enables or disables the ability to have a snapshot invalidated. *force_invalidate_snapshot* is a bit, with a default of 1.  
  
 1 specifies that changes to the article may cause the snapshot to be invalid, and if that is the case, a value of 1 gives permission for the new snapshot to occur.  
  
 0 specifies that changes to the article do not cause the snapshot to be invalid.  
  
 [ @force_reinit_subscription = ] *force_reinit_subscription*  
 Enables or disables the ability to have the subscription reinitializated. *force_reinit_subscription* is a bit with a default of 0.  
  
 0 specifies that changes to the article do not cause the subscription to be reinitialized.  
  
 1 specifies that changes to the article may cause the subscription to be reinitialized, and if that is the case, a value of 1 gives permission for the subscription reinitialization to occur.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 0 (success) or 1 (failure)  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the sysadmin fixed server role at the Publisher or members of the db_owner or db_ddladmin fixed database roles on the publication database can execute sp_repldropcolumn.
