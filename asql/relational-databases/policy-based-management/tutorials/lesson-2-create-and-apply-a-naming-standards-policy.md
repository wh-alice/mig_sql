# Lesson 2: Create and Apply a Naming Standards Policy
Some types of Policy-Based Management policies can create triggers to enforce future compliance with the policy. In this lesson, you create a policy that enforces a naming standard for tables. Then, you test the policy by trying to create a table that violates the policy.  
  
This lesson contains the following topics:  
  
-   [Create the Finance Name Policy](../Topic/Create%20the%20Finance%20Name%20Policy.md)
