# Lesson 5: Create a Simple Simulation (Data Science Deep Dive)
Until now you've been using R functions provided by SQL Server R Services that are designed specifically for moving data between [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and a local compute context. However, suppose you write a custom R function of your own, and want to run it in the server context?  
  
You can call an arbitrary function in the context of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] computer, by using the *rxExec* function. You can also use *rxExec* to explicitly distribute work across cores in a single server node.  
  
In this lesson, you'll use the remote server to create a simple simulation. The simulation doesn't require any [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data; the example only demonstrates how to design a custom function and then call it using the *rxExec* function.  
  
For a more complex example of using *rxExec*, see this article: [http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/04/coarse-grain-parallelism-with-foreach-and-rxexec.html](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/04/coarse-grain-parallelism-with-foreach-and-rxexec.html)  
  
## Create the Function  
A common casino game consists of rolling a pair of dice, with these rules:  
  
-   If you roll a 7 or 11 on your initial roll, you win.  
  
-   If you roll 2, 3, or 12, you lose.  
  
-   If you roll a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, that number becomes your point and you continue rolling until you either roll your point again (in which case you win) or roll a 7, in which case you lose.  
  
The game is easily simulated in R, by creating a custom function, and then running it many times.  
  
1.  Create the custom function using the following R code:  
  
    ```R  
    rollDice <- function()   
    {   
        result <- NULL        
        point <- NULL     
        count <- 1   
            while (is.null(result))   
            {   
                roll <- sum(sample(6, 2, replace=TRUE))   
  
                if (is.null(point))   
                { point <- roll }   
                if (count == 1 && (roll == 7 || roll == 11))   
                {  result <- "Win" }   
                else if (count == 1 && (roll == 2 || roll == 3 || roll == 12))    
                { result <- "Loss" }    
                else if (count > 1 && roll == 7 )   
                { result <- "Loss" }    
                else if (count > 1 && point == roll)   
                { result <- "Win" }    
                else { count <- count + 1 }   
            }   
            result   
    }  
  
    ```  
  
2.  To simulate a single game of dice,  run the function.  
  
    ```R  
    rollDice()   
    ```  
  
    Did you win or lose?  
  
Now let's see how you can  run the function multiple times, to create a simulation that helps determine the probability of a win.  
  
## Create the Simulation  
To run an arbitrary function in the context of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] computer, you call the *rxExec* function. Although *rxExec*  also supports  distributed execution of a function in parallel across nodes or cores in a server context, here you'll use it just to run your custom function on the server.  
  
1.  Call the custom function as an argument to *rxExec*, along with some other parameters that modify the simulation.  
  
    ```R  
    sqlServerExec <- rxExec(rollDice, timesToRun=20, RNGseed="auto")   
    length(sqlServerExec)   
    ```  
  
    -   Use the *timesToRun* argument to indicate how many times the function should be executed.  In this case, you roll the dice 20 times.  
  
    -   The arguments *RNGseed* and *RNGkind* can be used to control random number generation. When *RNGseed* is set to **auto**, a parallel random number stream is initialized on each worker.  
  
2.  The *rxExec* function creates a list with one element for each run; however, you won't see much happening until the list is complete. When all the iterations are complete, the line starting with `length` will return a value.  
  
    You can then go to the next step to get a summary of your win-loss record.  
  
3.  Convert the returned list to a vector using R's *unlist* function, and summarize the results using the *table* function.  
  
    ```R  
    table(unlist(sqlServerExec))  
    ```  
  
    Your results should look something like this:  
  
     *Loss  Win*   
     *12  8*  
  
## Conclusions  
In this tutorial, you have become proficient with these tasks:  
  
-   Getting [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data to use in analyses  
  
-   Creating and modifying data sources in R  
  
-   Passing models, data, and plots between your workstation and the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] server  
  
>  [!TIP]
> 
> If you would like to experiment with these techniques using a larger dataset of 10 million observations, the data files are available from [http://packages.revolutionanalytics.com/datasets](http://packages.revolutionanalytics.com/datasets).  
>   
> To re-use this walkthrough with the larger data files, just download the data and then modify the data sources as follows:   
>  -   Set the variables *ccFraudCsv* and *ccScoreCsv* to point to the new data files     
>  -   Change the name of the table referenced in *sqlFraudTable* to *ccFraud10*    
>  -   Change the name of the table referenced in *sqlScoreTable* to *ccFraudScore10*
