# SQL:BatchCompleted Event Class
  The SQL:BatchCompleted event class indicates that the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] batch has completed.  
  
## SQL:BatchCompleted Event Class Data Columns  
  
|Data column name|Data type|Description|Column ID|Filterable|  
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|  
|ApplicationName|**nvarchar**|Name of the client application that created the connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This column is populated with the values passed by the application rather than the displayed name of the program.|10|Yes|  
|ClientProcessID|**int**|ID assigned by the host computer to the process where the client application is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the client process ID.|9|Yes|  
|CPU|**int**|Amount of CPU time (in milliseconds) used by the batch.|18|Yes|  
|DatabaseID|**int**|ID of the database specified by the USE *database* statement or the default database if no USE *database* statement has been issued for a given instance. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../a9retired/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the ServerName data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|  
|DatabaseName|**nvarchar**|Name of the database in which the user statement is running.|35|Yes|  
|Duration|**bigint**|Amount of time (in microseconds) taken by the event.|13|Yes|  
|EndTime|**datetime**|Time at which the event ended. This column is not populated for starting event classes, such as SQL:BatchStarting or SP:Starting.|15|Yes|  
|Error|**int**|Error number of the event.<br /><br /> 0=OK<br /><br /> 1=Error<br /><br /> 2=Abort|31|Yes|  
|EventClass|**int**|Type of event = 12.|27|No|  
|EventSequence|**int**|Sequence of a given event within the request.|51|No|  
|GroupID|**int**|ID of the workload group where the SQL Trace event fires.|66|Yes|  
|HostName|**nvarchar**|Name of the computer on which the client is running. This data column is populated if the host name is provided by the client. To determine the host name, use the HOST_NAME function.|8|Yes|  
|IsSystem|**int**|Indicates whether the event occurred on a system process or a user process. 1 = system, 0 = user.|60|Yes|  
|LoginName|**nvarchar**|Name of the login of the user (either [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security login or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows login credentials in the form of DOMAIN\username).|11|Yes|  
|LoginSid|**image**|Security identification number (SID) of the logged-in user. You can find this information in the sys.server_principals catalog view. Each SID is unique for each login in the server.|41|Yes|  
|NTDomainName|**nvarchar**|Windows domain to which the user belongs.|7|Yes|  
|NTUserName|**nvarchar**|Windows user name.|6|Yes|  
|Reads|**bigint**|Number of page read I/Os caused by the batch.|16|Yes|  
|RequestID|**int**|ID of the request containing the statement.|49|Yes|  
|RowCounts|**bigint**|Number of rows affected by an event.|48|Yes|  
|ServerName|**nvarchar**|Name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] being traced.|26|No|  
|SessionLoginName|**nvarchar**|Login name of the user who originated the session. For example, if you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using Login1 and execute a statement as Login2, SessionLoginName shows Login1 and LoginName shows Login2. This column displays both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows logins.|64|Yes|  
|SPID|**int**|ID of the session on which the event occurred.|12|Yes|  
|StartTime|**datetime**|Time at which the event started, if available.|14|Yes|  
|TextData|**ntext**|Text of the batch.|1|Yes|  
|TransactionID|**bigint**|System-assigned ID of the transaction.|4|Yes|  
|Writes|**bigint**|Number of page write I/Os caused by the batch.|17|Yes|  
|XactSequence|**bigint**|Token that describes the current transaction.|50|Yes|
