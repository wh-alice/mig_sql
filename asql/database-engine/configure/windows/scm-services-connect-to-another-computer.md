# SCM Services - Connect to Another Computer
  This topic describes how to connect to another computer in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. Follow the first procedure to open the Windows Computer Management [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Management Console (mmc), connect to the computer, and expand the Services and Applications tree. Follow the second procedure to create a file with a link to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager on a remote computer.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Some actions cannot be performed by Configuration Manager when connecting remotely.  
  
 To start, stop, pause, or resume services on another computer, you can also connect to the server with [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], right-click the server or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent and then click the desired action.
