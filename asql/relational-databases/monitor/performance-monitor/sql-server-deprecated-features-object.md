# SQL Server, Deprecated Features Object
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  The SQLServer:Deprecated Features object in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides a counter to monitor the features designated as deprecated. In each case the counter provides a usage count that lists the number of times the deprecated feature was encountered since [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] last started.  
  
 The value of these counters are also available by executing the following statement:  
  
```  
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters   
WHERE object_name = 'SQLServer:Deprecated Features';  
```  

This following table describes the SQL Server **Deprecated Features** performance object.

|**SQL Server Deprecated Features counter**|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|**Usage**|Feature usage since last SQL Server startup.|
  
 The following table describes the SQL Server Deprecated Features counter instances.  
  
|SQL Server Deprecated Features counter instances|Description|
