# SQL Server Management Studio -  Release Notes
Welcome to our generally-available release of SQL Server Management Studio!  This release of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is a stand-alone install outside of the SQL Server release. Our goal is to update this frequently with new functionality, fixes, and support for the newest features in SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.  
  
To install the latest SQL Server Management Studio, see [Download SQL Server Management Studio &#40;SSMS&#41;](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio--ssms-.md).  
  
The following are issues and limitations with this release of SQL Server Management Studio:  

1. **Only a single Azure Active Directory account can log in for an SSMS instance using Active Directory Universal Authentication.**  
    This restriction is limited to Active Directory Universal Authentication - you can log in to different servers using Active Directory Password Authentication, Active Directory Integrated Authentication or SQL Server Authentication.
    
    As a workaround, you can use another instance of SSMS to login as another Azure Active Directory account. 
    
2. **Data-Tier Application Framework (DacFx) commands and the Schema Designer in SSMS do not support Active Directory Universal Authentication.**  
    Commands that use DacFx (e.g. import and export), the schema designer in SSMS do not currently support Active Directory Universal Authentication.
    
    As a workaround, you can use the other forms of authentication provided in SSMS - Active Directory Password Authentication, Active Directory Integrated Authentication or SQL Server Authentication.

3. **SSMS can only connect to SQL Server 2016 Integrated Services (SSIS 2016) instances.**  
    There is a known compatibility limitation with SQL Server Integration Services that prevents connecting to previous versions.
    
    As a workaround for this problem, you can connect to your SQL Server Integration Service instance by using the [SSMS release aligned with your SSIS instance.](../ssms/previous-sql-server-management-studio-releases.md) 
  
4. **SSMS won't save maintenance plans for SQL Server 2008 R2 and earlier SQL Server versions.**  
    This is a known limitation that we hope to address in the future. In the meantime, you can use the [SSMS 2014 release](../ssms/previous-sql-server-management-studio-releases.md) to save the maintenance plans.  
    
5. **Non-English SSMS installations may require the installation of an additional security package.**  
Non-English localized releases of SSMS [require the KB 2862966 security update package](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2862966) if installing on: Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
  
6. **SQL Server Configuration Manager will fail to launch if there is no SQL Server installed on the client machine**  
    If you do not have SQL Server installed on your client machine and launch SQL Server Configuration Manager, you will see the following error:   
     `Cannot connect to WMI provider. You do not have permission or the server is unreachable. Note that you can only manage SQL Server 2005 and later servers with SQL Server Configuration Manager. Invalid namespace \[0x8004100e]`,   
   
     * If you have added your SQL Server instances to 'Registered Servers' list in SSMS:  
        1. Navigate to 'Registered Servers' view in SSMS.  
        2. Right-click the SQL Server instance you would like to configure.  
        3. Select 'SQL Server Configuration Manager...' from the right-click menu.    
          
      * If you have not added a SQL Server instance to 'Registered Servers' list in SSMS:  
        1. Open a command promopt as Administrator.  
        2. Run the Mofcomp tool using the following command:  
    `mofcomp "%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Shared\sqlmgmproviderxpsp2up.mof"`  
        3. After you run the Mofcomp tool, run the following commands to restart the WMI service for the changes to take effect:  
        `net stop "Windows Management Instrumentation"`  
        `net start “Windows Management Instrumentation”`
