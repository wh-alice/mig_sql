# MDX Scripting - FREEZE
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Locks the cell values of a specified subcube to their current values. When the cell values are locked, changes to other cells have no effect on the cells that are locked.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
FREEZE Subcube_Expression   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Subcube_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a subcube.  
  
## Remarks  
 The **FREEZE** statement locks the values of cells in a specified subcube, preventing subsequent statements in an MDX script from changing their values in subsequent calculation passes.  
  
 In the following example, A and B represent subcubes in an MDX calculation script:  
  
```  
B = 2;  
A = B;  
B = 3  
```  
  
 At this point, both A and B are equal to 3.  
  
 We now insert the **Freeze** function to lock the cells in the A subcube:  
  
```  
B = 2;  
A = B;  
FREEZE(A);  
B = 3  
```  
  
 A is now equal to 2, and B is equal to 3.
