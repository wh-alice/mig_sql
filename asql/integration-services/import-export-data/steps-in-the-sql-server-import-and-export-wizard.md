# Steps in the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard
This topic describes the sequence of steps for importing and exporting data with the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard. It also contains links to the individual pages of documentation that describe each page or dialog box you see in the wizard.

This topic describes only the **steps** in the wizard. If you're looking for something else, see [Related tasks and content](#related).

## Steps for importing and exporting data  
 The following table lists the steps for importing and exporting data and the corresponding pages of the wizard. Depending on the options that you select in the wizard, you typically don't see all these pages.  

For a quick look at the several screens you see in a typical session, take a look at this simple end-to-end example on a single page - [Get started with this simple example of the Import and Export Wizard](../../integration-services/import-export-data/get-started-with-this-simple-example-of-the-import-and-export-wizard.md).

    -   **If you prefer to see screen shots.** Take a look at this simple end-to-end example on a single page - [Get started with this simple example of the Import and Export Wizard](../../integration-services/import-export-data/get-started-with-this-simple-example-of-the-import-and-export-wizard.md).
    -   **If you prefer to watch a video.** Watch this four-minute video from YouTube that demonstrates the wizard and explains clearly and simply how to export data to Excel - [Using the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard to Export to Excel](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=829049).
-   **Learn more about how the wizard works.**
    -   **Learn more about the wizard.** If you're looking for an overview of the wizard, see [Import and Export Data with the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](../../integration-services/import-export-data/import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).
    -   **Learn how to connect to data sources and destinations.** If you're looking for info about how to connect to your data, select the page you want from the list here - [Connect to data sources with the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-data-sources-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md). There's a separate page of documentation for each of several commonly used data sources. 
-   **Start the wizard.** If you're ready to run the wizard and just want to know how to start it, see [Start the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](../../integration-services/import-export-data/start-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).
-   **Get the wizard.** If you want to run the wizard, but you don't have [!INCLUDE[msCoName] (../Token/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installed on your computer, you can install the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard  by installing SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).
