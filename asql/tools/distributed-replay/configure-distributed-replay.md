# Configure Distributed Replay
  The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay configuration details are specified in XML files on the Distributed Replay controller, clients, and where the administration tool is installed. These files include the following:  
  
-   [Controller configuration file](#DReplayController)  
  
-   [Client configuration file](#DReplayClient)  
  
-   [Preprocess configuration file](#PreprocessConfig)  
  
-   [Replay configuration file](#ReplayConfig)  
  
##  <a name="DReplayController"></a> Controller Configuration File: DReplayController.config  
 When the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay controller service starts, it loads the logging level from the controller configuration file, `DReplayController.config`. This file is located in the folder where you installed the Distributed Replay controller service:  
  
 **\<controller installation path>\DReplayController.config**  
  
 The logging level specified by the controller configuration file includes the following:  
  
|Setting|XML Element|Description|Allowed Values|Required|  
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|  
|Logging level|`<LoggingLevel>`|Specifies the logging level for the controller service.|`INFORMATION` &#124; `WARNING` &#124; `CRITICAL`|No. By default, the value is `CRITICAL`.|  
  
### Example  
 This example shows a controller configuration file that has been modified to suppress `INFORMATION` and `WARNING` log entries.  
  
```  
<?xml version='1.0'?>  
<Options>  
<LoggingLevel>CRITICAL</LoggingLevel>  
</Options>  
```  
  
##  <a name="DReplayClient"></a> Client Configuration File: DReplayClient.config  
 When the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay client service starts, it loads configuration settings from the client configuration file, `DReplayClient.config`. This file is located on each client, in the folder where you installed the Distributed Replay client service:  
  
 **\<client installation path>\DReplayClient.config**  
  
 The settings specified by the client configuration file include the following:  
  
|Setting|XML Element|Description|Allowed Values|Required|  
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|  
|Controller|`<Controller>`|Specifies the computer name of the controller. The client will attempt to register with the Distributed Replay environment by contacting the controller.|You can use "`localhost`" or "`.`" to refer to the local computer.|No. By default, the client tries to register with the controller instance that is running locally ("`.`"), if it exists.|  
|Client working directory|`<WorkingDirectory>`|Is the local path on the client where the dispatch files are saved.<br /><br /> The files in this directory are overwritten on the next replay.|A full directory name, starting with the drive letter.|No. If no value is specified, the dispatch files will be saved in the same location as the default client configuration file. If a value is specified and that folder does not exist on the client, the client service will not start.|  
|Client result directory|`<ResultDirectory>`|Is the local path on the client where the result trace file from the replay activity (for the client) is saved.<br /><br /> The files in this directory are overwritten on the next replay.|A full directory name, starting with the drive letter.|No. If no value is specified, the result trace file will be saved in the same location as the default client configuration file. If a value is specified and that folder does not exist on the client, the client service will not start.|  
|Logging level|`<LoggingLevel>`|Is the logging level for the client service.|`INFORMATION` &#124; `WARNING` &#124; `CRITICAL`|No. By default, the value is `CRITICAL`.|  
  
### Example  
 This example shows a client configuration file that has been modified to specify that the controller service is running on a different computer, a computer named `Controller1`. The `WorkingDirectory` and `ResultDirectory` elements have been configured to use folders `c:\ClientWorkingDir` and `c:\ResultTraceDir`, respectively. The logging level has been changed from the default value to suppress `INFORMATION` and `WARNING` log entries.  
  
```  
<?xml version='1.0'?>  
<Options>  
    <Controller>Controller1</Controller>  
    <WorkingDirectory>c:\ClientWorkingDir</WorkingDirectory>  
    <ResultDirectory>c:\ResultTraceDir</ResultDirectory>  
    <LoggingLevel>CRITICAL</LoggingLevel>  
</Options>  
```  
  
##  <a name="PreprocessConfig"></a> Preprocess Configuration File: DReplay.exe.preprocess.config  
 When you use the administration tool to initiate the preprocess stage, the administration tool loads the preprocess settings from the preprocess configuration file, `DReplay.exe.preprocess.config`.  
  
 Use the default configuration file or use the administration tool **-c** parameter to specify the location of a modified preprocess configuration file. For more information about using the preprocess option of the administration tool, see [Preprocess Option &#40;Distributed Replay Administration Tool&#41;](../../tools/distributed-replay/preprocess-option-distributed-replay-administration-tool.md).  
  
 The default preprocess configuration file is located in the folder where you installed the administration tool:  
  
 **\<administration tool installation path>\DReplayAdmin\DReplay.exe.preprocess.config**  
  
 The preprocess configuration settings are specified in XML elements that are children of the `<PreprocessModifiers>` element in the preprocess configuration file. These settings include the following:  
  
|Setting|XML Element|Description|Allowed Values|Required|  
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|  
|Include system session activities|`<IncSystemSession>`|Indicates whether system session activities during the capture will be included during replay.|`Yes` &#124; `No`|No. By default, the value is `No`.|  
|Maximum idle time|`<MaxIdleTime>`|Caps the idle time to an absolute number (in seconds).|An integer that is >= -1.<br /><br /> `-1` indicates no change from the original value in the original trace file.<br /><br /> `0` indicates that there is some activity going on at any given point in time.|No. By default, the value is `-1`.|  
  
### Example  
 The default preprocess configuration file:  
  
```  
<?xml version='1.0'?>  
<Options>  
    <PreprocessModifiers>  
        <IncSystemSession>No</IncSystemSession>  
        <MaxIdleTime>-1</MaxIdleTime>  
    </PreprocessModifiers>  
</Options>  
```  
  
##  <a name="ReplayConfig"></a> Replay Configuration File: DReplay.exe.replay.config  
 When you use the administration tool to initiate the event replay stage, the administration tool loads the replay settings from the replay configuration file, `DReplay.exe.replay.config`.  
  
 Use the default configuration file or use the administration tool **-c** parameter to specify the location of a modified replay configuration file. For more information about using the replay option of the administration tool, see [Replay Option &#40;Distributed Replay Administration Tool&#41;](../../tools/distributed-replay/replay-option-distributed-replay-administration-tool.md).  
  
 The default replay configuration file is located in the folder where you installed the administration tool:  
  
 **\<administration tool installation path>\DReplayAdmin\DReplay.exe.replay.config**  
  
 The replay configuration settings are specified in XML elements that are children of the `<ReplayOptions>` and `<OutputOptions>` elements of the replay configuration file.  
  
### \<ReplayOptions> Element  
 The settings specified by the replay configuration file in the `<ReplayOptions>` element include the following:
