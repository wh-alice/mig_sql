# CREATE COLUMN MASTER KEY (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/data-compression/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Creates a column master key metadata object in a database. A column master key metadata entry that represents a key, stored in an external key store, which is used to protect (encrypt) column encryption keys when using the [Always Encrypted &#40;Database Engine&#41;](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine.md) feature. Multiple column master keys allow for key rotation; periodically changing the key to enhance security. You can create a column master key in a key store and its corresponding metadata object in the database by using the Object Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or PowerShell. For details, see [Overview of Key Management for Always Encrypted](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/overview-of-key-management-for-always-encrypted.md).

## Syntax  
  
```  
CREATE COLUMN MASTER KEY key_name   
    WITH (  
        KEY_STORE_PROVIDER_NAME = 'key_store_provider_name',  
        KEY_PATH = 'key_path'   
         )   
[;]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *key_name*  
 Is the name by which the column master key will be known in the database.  
  
 *key_store_provider_name*  
 Specifies the name of a key store provider, which is a client-side software component that encapsulates a key store containing the column master key. An Always Encrypted-enabled client driver uses a key store provider name to look up a key store provider in driverâ€™s registry of key store providers. The driver uses the provider to decrypt column encryption keys, protected by a column master key, stored in the underlying key store. A plaintext value of the column encryption key is then used to encrypt query parameters, corresponding to encrypted database columns, or to decrypt query results from encrypted columns.  
  
 Always Encrypted-enabled client driver libraries include key store providers for popular key stores.   
  
A set of available providers depend on the type and the version of the client driver. Please refer to the Always Encrypted documentation for particular drivers:

[Develop Applications using Always Encrypted with the .NET Framework Provider for SQL Server](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/827e509e-3c4f-4820-aa37-cebf0f7bbf80.md)


The below tables captures the names of system providers:  
  
|Key store provider name|Underlying key store|  
    |-----------------------------|--------------------------|
    |'MSSQL_CERTIFICATE_STORE'|Windows Certificate Store| 
    |'MSSQL_CSP_PROVIDER'|A store, such as a hardware security module (HSM), that supports Microsoft CryptoAPI.|
    |'MSSQL_CNG_STORE'|A store, such as a hardware security module (HSM), that supports Cryptography API: Next Generation.|  
    |'Azure_Key_Vault'|See [Getting Started with Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/key-vault-get-started/)|  
  

 You can implement a custom key store provider, in order to store column master keys in a store for which there is no built-in key store provider in your Always Encrypted-enabled client driver.  Note that the names of custom key store providers cannot start with 'MSSQL_', which is a prefix reserved for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] key store providers. 

  
 key_path  
 The path of the key in the column master key store. The key path must be valid in the context of each client application that is expected to encrypt or decrypt data stored in a column (indirectly) protected by the referenced column master key and the client application needs to be permitted to access the key. The format of the key path is specific to the key store provider. The following list describes the format of key paths for particular Microsoft system key store providers.  
  
-   **Provider name:** MSSQL_CERTIFICATE_STORE  
  
     **Key path format:** *CertificateStoreName*/*CertificateStoreLocation*/*CertificateThumbprint*  
  
     Where:  
  
     *CertificateStoreLocation*  
     Certificate store location, which must be Current User or Local Machine. For more information, see [Local Machine and Current User Certificate Stores](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548653.aspx).  
  
     *CertificateStore*  
     Certificate store name, for example 'My'.  
  
     *CertificateThumbprint*  
     Certificate thumbprint.  
  
     **Examples:**  
  
    ```  
    N'CurrentUser/My/BBF037EC4A133ADCA89FFAEC16CA5BFA8878FB94'  
  
    N'LocalMachine/My/CA5BFA8878FB94BBF037EC4A133ADCA89FFAEC16'  
    ```  
  
-   **Provider name:** MSSQL_CSP_PROVIDER  
  
     **Key path format:** *ProviderName*/*KeyIdentifier*  
  
     Where:  
  
     *ProviderName*  
     The name a Cryptography Service Provider (CSP), which implements CAPI, for the column master key store. If you use an HSM as a key store, this must be the name of the CSP your HSM vendor supplies. The provider must be installed on a client computer.  
  
     *KeyIdentifier*  
     Identifier of the key, used as a column master key, in the key store.  
  
     **Examples:**  
  
    ```  
    N'My HSM CSP Provider/AlwaysEncryptedKey1'  
    ```  
  
-   **Provider name:** MSSQL_CNG_STORE  
  
     **Key path format:** *ProviderName*/*KeyIdentifier*  
  
     Where:  
  
     *ProviderName*  
     Name of the Key Storage Provider (KSP), which implements the Cryptography: Next Generation (CNG) API, for the column master key store. If you use an HSM as a key store, this must be the name of the KSP your HSM vendor supplies. The provider needs to be installed on a client computer.  
  
     *KeyIdentifier*  
     Identifier of the key, used as a column master key, in the key store.  
  
     **Examples:**  
  
    ```  
    N'My HSM CNG Provider/AlwaysEncryptedKey1'  
    ```  

-   **Provider name:** AZURE_KEY_STORE  
  
     **Key path format:** *KeyUrl*  
  
     Where:  
  
     *KeyUrl*  
     The URL of the key in Azure Key Vault


Example:
 
**N'https://myvault.vault.azure.net:443/keys/MyCMK/4c05f1a41b12488f9cba2ea964b6a700**'.  
  
## Remarks  

Creating a column master key metadata entry is required before a column encryption key metadata entry can be created in the database and before any column in the database can be encrypted using Always Encrypted. Note that, a column master key entry in the metadata does not contain the actual column master key, which must be stored in an external column key store (outside of SQL Server). The key store provider name and the column master key path in the metadata must be valid for a client application to be able to use the column master key to decrypt a column encryption key encrypted with the column master key, and to query encrypted columns.


  
## Permissions  
 Requires  the **ALTER ANY COLUMN MASTER KEY** permission.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Creating a column master key  
 Creating a column master key metadata entry for a column master key stored in Certificate Store, for client applications that use the MSSQL_CERTIFICATE_STORE provider to access the column master key:  
  
```  
CREATE COLUMN MASTER KEY MyCMK  
WITH (  
     KEY_STORE_PROVIDER_NAME = N'MSSQL_CERTIFICATE_STORE',   
     KEY_PATH = 'Current User/Personal/f2260f28d909d21c642a3d8e0b45a830e79a1420'  
   );  
```  
  
 Creating a column master key metadata entry for a column master key that is accessed by client applications that use the MSSQL_CNG_STORE provider:  
  
```  
CREATE COLUMN MASTER KEY MyCMK  
WITH (  
    KEY_STORE_PROVIDER_NAME = N'MSSQL_CNG_STORE',    
    KEY_PATH = N'My HSM CNG Provider/AlwaysEncryptedKey'  
);  
```  
  
 Creating a column master key stored in the Azure Key Vault, for client applications that use the AZURE_KEY_VAULT provider, to access the column master key.  
  
```  
CREATE COLUMN MASTER KEY MyCMK  
WITH (  
    KEY_STORE_PROVIDER_NAME = N'AZURE_KEY_VAULT',  
    KEY_PATH = N'https://myvault.vault.azure.net:443/keys/  
        MyCMK/4c05f1a41b12488f9cba2ea964b6a700');  
```  
  
 Creating a CMK stored in a custom column master key store:  
  
```  
CREATE COLUMN MASTER KEY MyCMK  
WITH (  
    KEY_STORE_PROVIDER_NAME = 'CUSTOM_KEY_STORE',    
    KEY_PATH = 'https://contoso.vault/sales_db_tce_key'  
);  
```
