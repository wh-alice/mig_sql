# Create and Run an MDX Script in SQL Server Data Tools
  To create and run an MDX Script in  [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], you need to be in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] with a cube already created and ready for editing.  
  
### To create a Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) script  
  
1.  Open the cube for which you want to create an MDX script, and under **View**, click **Calculations**.  
  
2.  If you are not in **Script View** mode, click the **Script View** icon.  
  
3.  In the script window, under the CALCULATE command, type an MDX expression. Click the **Check Syntax** icon and verify that the expression is syntactically correct.  
  
4.  To run the MDX script, deploy and process the cube with the new MDX script changes.
