# xp_cmdshell Server Configuration Option
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  The **xp_cmdshell** option is a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] server configuration option that enables system administrators to control whether the **xp_cmdshell** extended stored procedure can be executed on a system. By default, the **xp_cmdshell** option is disabled on new installations and can be enabled by using the Policy-Based Management or by running the **sp_configure** system stored procedure as shown in the following code example:  
  
```  
-- To allow advanced options to be changed.  
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;  
GO  
-- To update the currently configured value for advanced options.  
RECONFIGURE;  
GO  
-- To enable the feature.  
EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;  
GO  
-- To update the currently configured value for this feature.  
RECONFIGURE;  
GO  
```
