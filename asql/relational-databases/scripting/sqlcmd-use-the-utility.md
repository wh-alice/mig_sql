# sqlcmd - Use the Utility
  The **sqlcmd** utility is a command-line utility for ad hoc, interactive execution of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements and scripts and for automating [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] scripting tasks. To use **sqlcmd** interactively, or to build script files to be run using **sqlcmd**, users must understand [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)]. The **sqlcmd** utility is typically used in the following ways:  
  
-   Users interactively enter [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements in a manner similar to working at the command prompt. The results are displayed at the command prompt. To open a Command Prompt window, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, point to **Accessories**, and then click **Command Prompt**. At the command prompt, type **sqlcmd** followed by a list of options that you want. For a complete list of the options that are supported by **sqlcmd**, see [sqlcmd Utility](../../tools/sqlcmd-utility.md).  
  
-   Users submit a **sqlcmd** job either by specifying a single [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement to execute, or by pointing the utility to a text file that contains [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements to execute. The output is usually directed to a text file, but it can also be displayed at the command prompt.  
  
-   [SQLCMD mode](../../relational-databases/scripting/edit-sqlcmd-scripts-with-query-editor.md) in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Query Editor.  
  
-   SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)  
  
-   SQL Server Agent CmdExec jobs.  
  
## Typically Used sqlcmd Options  
 The following options are used most frequently:  
  
-   The server option (**-S**) that identifies the instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to which **sqlcmd** connects.  
  
-   Authentication options (**-E**, **-U**, and **-P**) that specify the credentials that **sqlcmd** uses to connect to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
    > **NOTE:** The **-E** option is the default and does not have to be specified.  
  
-   Input options (**-Q**, **-q**, and **-i**) that identify the location of the input to **sqlcmd**.  
  
-   The output option (**-o**) that specifies the file in which **sqlcmd** is to put its output.  
  
## Connecting to the sqlcmd Utility  
 The following are common uses of the **sqlcmd** utility:  
  
-   Connecting to a default instance by using Windows Authentication to interactively run [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements:  
  
    ```  
    sqlcmd -S <ComputerName>  
    ```  
  
    > **NOTE:** In the previous example, **-E** is not specified because it is the default and **sqlcmd** connects to the default instance by using Windows Authentication.  
  
-   Connecting to a named instance by using Windows Authentication to interactively run [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements:  
  
    ```  
    sqlcmd -S <ComputerName>\<InstanceName>  
    ```  
  
     or  
  
    ```  
    sqlcmd -S .\<InstanceName>  
    ```  
  
-   Connecting to a named instance by using Windows Authentication and specifying input and output files:  
  
    ```  
    sqlcmd -S <ComputerName>\<InstanceName> -i <MyScript.sql> -o <MyOutput.rpt>  
    ```  
  
-   Connecting to the default instance on the local computer by using Windows Authentication, executing a query, and having **sqlcmd** remain running after the query has finished running:  
  
    ```  
    sqlcmd -q "SELECT * FROM AdventureWorks2012.Person.Person"  
    ```  
  
-   Connecting to the default instance on the local computer by using Windows Authentication, executing a query, directing the output to a file, and having **sqlcmd** exit after the query has finished running:  
  
    ```  
    sqlcmd -Q "SELECT * FROM AdventureWorks2012.Person.Person" -o MyOutput.txt  
    ```  
  
-   Connecting to a named instance using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication to interactively run [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, with **sqlcmd** prompting for a password:  
  
    ```  
    sqlcmd -U MyLogin -S <ComputerName>\<InstanceName>  
    ```  
  
    > **HINT!!** To see a list of the options that are supported by the **sqlcmd** utility run: `sqlcmd -?`.  
  
## Running Transact-SQL Statements Interactively by Using sqlcmd  
 You can use the **sqlcmd** utility interactively to execute [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements in a Command Prompt window. To interactively execute [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements by using **sqlcmd**, run the utility without using the **-Q**, **-q**, **-Z**, or **-i** options to specify any input files or queries. For example:  
  
 `sqlcmd -S <ComputerName>\<InstanceName>`  
  
 When the command is executed without input files or queries, **sqlcmd** connects to the specified instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and then displays a new line with a `1>` followed by a blinking underscore that is named the **sqlcmd** prompt. The `1` signifies that this is the first line of a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement, and the **sqlcmd** prompt is the point at which the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement will start when you type it in.  
  
 At the **sqlcmd** prompt, you can type both [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements and **sqlcmd** commands, such as **GO** and **EXIT**. Each [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement is put in a buffer called the statement cache. These statements are sent to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] after you type the **GO** command and press ENTER. To exit **sqlcmd**, type **EXIT** or **QUIT** at the start of a new line.  
  
 To clear the statement cache, type **:RESET**. Typing **^C** causes **sqlcmd** to exit. **^C** can also be used to stop the execution of the statement cache after a **GO** command has been issued.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that are entered in an interactive session can edited by entering the **:ED** command and the **sqlcmd** prompt. The editor will open and, after editing the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement and closing the editor, the revised [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement will appear in the command window. Enter **GO** to run therevised [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement.  
  
## Quoted Strings  
 Characters that are enclosed in quotation marks are used without any additional preprocessing, except that quotations marks can be inserted into a string by entering two consecutive quotation marks. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] treats this character sequence as one quotation mark. (However, the translation occurs in the server.) Scripting variables will not be expanded when they appear within a string.  
  
 For example:  
  
 `sqlcmd`  
  
 `PRINT "Length: 5"" 7'";`  
  
 `GO`  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 `Length: 5" 7'`  
  
## Strings That Span Multiple Lines  
 **sqlcmd** supports scripts that have strings that span multiple lines. For example, the following `SELECT` statement spans multiple lines but is a single string executed when you press the ENTER key after typing `GO`.  
  
 `SELECT First line`  
  
 `FROM Second line`  
  
 `WHERE Third line;`  
  
 `GO`  
  
## Interactive sqlcmd Example  
 This is an example of what you see when you run **sqlcmd** interactively.  
  
 When you open a Command Prompt window, there is one line similar to:  
  
 `C:\> _`  
  
 This means the folder `C:\` is the current folder, and if you specify a file name, Windows will look for the file in that folder.  
  
 Type **sqlcmd** to connect to the default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on the local computer, and the contents of the Command Prompt window will be:  
  
 `C:\>sqlcmd`  
  
 `1> _`  
  
 This means you have connected to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and `sqlcmd` is now ready to accept [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements and `sqlcmd` commands. The flashing underscore after the `1>` is the `sqlcmd` prompt that marks the location at which the statements and commands you type will be displayed. Now, type **USE AdventureWorks2012** and press ENTER, and then type **GO** and press ENTER. The contents of the Command Prompt window will be:  
  
 `sqlcmd`  
  
 `USE AdventureWorks2012;`  
  
 `GO`  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 `Changed database context to 'AdventureWorks2012'.`  
  
 `1> _`  
  
 Pressing ENTER after entering `USE AdventureWorks2012` signaled `sqlcmd` to start a new line. Pressing ENTER, after you type `GO,` signaled `sqlcmd` to send the `USE AdventureWorks2012` statement to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. `sqlcmd` then returned a message to indicate that the `USE` statement completed successfully and displayed a new `1>` prompt as a signal to enter a new statement or command.  
  
 The following example shows what the Command Prompt window contains if you type a `SELECT` statement, a `GO` to execute the `SELECT`, and an `EXIT` to exit `sqlcmd`:  
  
 `sqlcmd`  
  
 `USE AdventureWorks2012;`  
  
 `GO`  
  
 `SELECT TOP (3) BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName`  
  
 `FROM Person.Person;`  
  
 `GO`  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 `BusinessEntityID   FirstName                 LastName`  
  
 `----------- -------------------------------- -----------`  
  
 `1           Syed                             Abbas`  
  
 `2           Catherine                        Abel`  
  
 `3           Kim                              Abercrombie`  
  
 `(3 rows affected)`  
  
 `1> EXIT`  
  
 `C:\>`  
  
 The lines after line `3> GO` are the output of a `SELECT` statement. After you generate output, `sqlcmd` resets the `sqlcmd` prompt and displays `1>`. After entering `EXIT` at line `1>`, the Command Prompt window displays the same line it did when you first opened it. This indicates that `sqlcmd` has exited its session. You can now close the Command Prompt window by typing another `EXIT` command.  
  
## Running Transact-SQL Script Files by Using sqlcmd  
 You can use **sqlcmd** to execute database script files. Script files are text files that contain a mix of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, **sqlcmd** commands, and scripting variables. For more information about how to script variables, see [Use sqlcmd with Scripting Variables](../../relational-databases/scripting/sqlcmd-use-with-scripting-variables.md). **sqlcmd** works with the statements, commands, and scripting variables in a script file in a manner similar to how it works with statements and commands that are entered interactively. The main difference is that **sqlcmd** reads through the input file without pause instead of waiting for a user to enter the statements, commands, and scripting variables.  
  
 There are different ways to create database script files:  
  
-   You can interactively build and debug a set of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], and then save the contents of the Query window as a script file.  
  
-   You can create a text file that contains [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements by using a text editor, such as Notepad.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Running a script by using sqlcmd  
 Start Notepad, and type the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements:  
  
 `USE AdventureWorks2012;`  
  
 `GO`  
  
 `SELECT TOP (3) BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName`  
  
 `FROM Person.Person;`  
  
 `GO`  
  
 Create a folder named `MyFolder` and then save the script as the file `MyScript.sql` in the folder `C:\MyFolder`. Enter the following at the command prompt to run the script and put the output in `MyOutput.txt` in `MyFolder`:  
  
 `sqlcmd -i C:\MyFolder\MyScript.sql -o C:\MyFolder\MyOutput.txt`  
  
 When you view the contents of `MyOutput.txt` in Notepad, you will see the following:  
  
 `Changed database context to 'AdventureWorks2012'.`  
  
 `BusinessEntityID FirstName   LastName`  
  
 `---------------- ----------- -----------`  
  
 `1                Syed        Abbas`  
  
 `2                Catherine   Abel`  
  
 `3                Kim         Abercrombie`  
  
 `(3 rows affected)`  
  
### B. Using sqlcmd with a dedicated administrative connection  
 In the following example, `sqlcmd` is used to connect to a server that has a blocking problem by using the dedicated administrator connection (DAC).  
  
 `C:\>sqlcmd -S ServerName -A`  
  
 `1> SELECT blocked FROM sys.dm_exec_requests WHERE blocked <> 0;`  
  
 `2> GO`  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 `spid   blocked`  
  
 `------ -------`  
  
 `62       64`  
  
 `(1 rows affected)`  
  
 Use `sqlcmd` to end the blocking process.  
  
 `1> KILL 64;`  
  
 `2> GO`  
  
### C. Using sqlcmd to execute a stored procedure  
 The following example shows how to execute a stored procedure by using `sqlcmd`. Create the following stored procedure.  
  
 `USE AdventureWorks2012;`  
  
 `IF OBJECT_ID ( ' dbo.ContactEmailAddress, 'P' ) IS NOT NULL`  
  
 `DROP PROCEDURE dbo.ContactEmailAddress;`  
  
 `GO`  
  
 `CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.ContactEmailAddress`  
  
 `(`  
  
 `@FirstName nvarchar(50)`  
  
 `,@LastName nvarchar(50)`  
  
 `)`  
  
 `AS`  
  
 `SET NOCOUNT ON`  
  
 `SELECT EmailAddress`  
  
 `FROM Person.Person`  
  
 `WHERE FirstName = @FirstName`  
  
 `AND LastName = @LastName;`  
  
 `SET NOCOUNT OFF`  
  
 At the `sqlcmd` prompt, enter the following:  
  
 `C:\sqlcmd`  
  
 `1> :Setvar FirstName Gustavo`  
  
 `1> :Setvar LastName Achong`  
  
 `1> EXEC dbo.ContactEmailAddress $(Gustavo),$(Achong)`  
  
 `2> GO`  
  
 `EmailAddress`  
  
 `-----------------------------`  
  
 `gustavo0@adventure-works.com`  
  
### D. Using sqlcmd for database maintenance  
 The following example shows how to use `sqlcmd` for a database maintenance task. Create `C:\BackupTemplate.sql` with the following code.  
  
 `USE master;`  
  
 `BACKUP DATABASE [$(db)] TO DISK='$(bakfile)';`  
  
 At the `sqlcmd` prompt, enter the following:  
  
 `C:\ >sqlcmd`  
  
 `1> :connect <server>`  
  
 `Sqlcmd: Successfully connected to server <server>.`  
  
 `1> :setvar db msdb`  
  
 `1> :setvar bakfile c:\msdb.bak`  
  
 `1> :r c:\BackupTemplate.sql`  
  
 `2> GO`  
  
 `Changed database context to 'master'.`  
  
 `Processed 688 pages for database 'msdb', file 'MSDBData' on file 2.`  
  
 `Processed 5 pages for database 'msdb', file 'MSDBLog' on file 2.`  
  
 `BACKUP DATABASE successfully processed 693 pages in 0.725 seconds (7.830 MB/sec)`  
  
### E. Using sqlcmd to execute code on multiple instances  
 The following code in a file shows a script that connects to two instances. Notice the `GO` before the connection to the second instance.  
  
 `:CONNECT <server>\,<instance1>`  
  
 `EXEC dbo.SomeProcedure`  
  
 `GO`  
  
 `:CONNECT <server>\,<instance2>`  
  
 `EXEC dbo.SomeProcedure`  
  
 `GO`  
  
### E. Returning XML output  
 The following example shows how XML output is returned unformatted, in a continuous stream.  
  
 `C:\>sqlcmd -d AdventureWorks2012`  
  
 `1> :XML ON`  
  
 `1> SELECT TOP 3 FirstName + ' ' + LastName + ', '`  
  
 `2> FROM Person.Person`  
  
 `3> GO`  
  
 `Syed Abbas, Catherine Abel, Kim Abercrombie,`  
  
### F. Using sqlcmd in a Windows script file  
 A **sqlcmd**command such as `sqlcmd -i C:\InputFile.txt -o C:\OutputFile.txt,` can be executed in a .bat file together with VBScript. In this case, do not use interactive options. **sqlcmd** must be installed on the computer that is executing the .bat file.  
  
 First, create the following four files:  
  
-   C:\badscript.sql  
  
    ```  
    SELECT batch_1_this_is_an_error  
    GO  
    SELECT 'batch #2'  
    GO  
    ```  
  
-   C:\goodscript.sql  
  
    ```  
    SELECT 'batch #1'  
    GO  
    SELECT 'batch #2'  
    GO  
    ```  
  
-   C:\returnvalue.sql  
  
    ```  
    :exit(select 100)  
    @echo off  
    C:\windowsscript.bat  
    @echo off  
  
    echo Running badscript.sql  
    sqlcmd -i badscript.sql -b -o out.log  
    if not errorlevel 1 goto next1  
    echo == An error occurred   
  
    :next1  
  
    echo Running goodscript.sql  
    sqlcmd -i goodscript.sql -b -o out.log  
    if not errorlevel 1 goto next2  
    echo == An error occurred   
  
    :next2  
    echo Running returnvalue.sql  
    sqlcmd -i returnvalue.sql -o out.log  
    echo SQLCMD returned %errorlevel% to the command shell  
  
    :exit  
    ```  
  
-   C:\windowsscript.bat  
  
    ```  
    @echo off  
  
    echo Running badscript.sql  
    sqlcmd -i badscript.sql -b -o out.log  
    if not errorlevel 1 goto next1  
    echo == An error occurred   
  
    :next1  
  
    echo Running goodscript.sql  
    sqlcmd -i goodscript.sql -b -o out.log  
    if not errorlevel 1 goto next2  
    echo == An error occurred   
  
    :next2  
    echo Running returnvalue.sql  
    sqlcmd -i returnvalue.sql -o out.log  
    echo SQLCMD returned %errorlevel% to the command shell  
  
    :exit  
    ```  
  
 Then, at the command prompt, run `C:\windowsscript.bat`:  
  
 `C:\>windowsscript.bat`  
  
 `Running badscript.sql`  
  
 `== An error occurred`  
  
 `Running goodscript.sql`  
  
 `Running returnvalue.sql`  
  
 `SQLCMD returned 100 to the command shell`  
  
### G. Using sqlcmd to set encryption on Windows Azure SQL Database  
 A **sqlcmd**can be executed on a connection to [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] data on to specify encryption and certificate trust. Two **sqlcmd**``options are available:  
  
-   The -N switch is used by the client to request an encrypted connection. This option is equivalent to the ADO.net option `ENCRYPT = true`.  
  
-   The –C switch is used by the client to configure it to implicitly the trust server certificate and not validate it. This option is equivalent to the ADO.net option `TRUSTSERVERCERTIFICATE = true`.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] service does not support all the `SET` options available on a SQL Server instance. The following options throw an error when the corresponding `SET` option is set to `ON` or `OFF`:  
  
-   SET ANSI_DEFAULTS  
  
-   SET ANSI_NULLS  
  
-   SET REMOTE_PROC_TRANSACTIONS  
  
-   SET ANSI_NULL_DEFAULT  
  
 The following SET options do not throw exceptions but cannot be used. They are deprecated:  
  
-   SET CONCAT_NULL_YIELDS_NULL  
  
-   SET ANSI_PADDING  
  
-   SET QUERY_GOVERNOR_COST_LIMIT  
  
#### Syntax  
 The following examples refer to cases where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client Provider settings include: `ForceProtocolEncryption = False`, `Trust Server Certificate = No`  
  
 Connect using Windows credentials and encrypt communication:  
  
```  
SQLCMD –E –N  
  
```  
  
 Connect using Windows credentials and trust server certificate:  
  
```  
SQLCMD –E –C  
  
```  
  
 Connect using Windows credentials, encrypt communication and trust server certificate:  
  
```  
SQLCMD –E –N –C  
  
```  
  
 The following examples refer to cases where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client Provider settings include: `ForceProtocolEncryption = True`, `TrustServerCertificate = Yes`.  
  
 Connect using Windows credentials, encrypt communication and trust server certificate:  
  
```  
SQLCMD –E  
  
```  
  
 Connect using Windows credentials, encrypt communication and trust server certificate:  
  
```  
SQLCMD –E –N  
  
```  
  
 Connect using Windows credentials, encrypt communication and trust server certificate:  
  
```  
SQLCMD –E –T  
  
```  
  
 Connect using Windows credentials, encrypt communication and trust server certificate:  
  
```  
SQLCMD –E –N –C  
  
```  
  
 If the provider specifies `ForceProtocolEncryption = True` then encryption is enabled even if `Encrypt=No` in the connection string.
