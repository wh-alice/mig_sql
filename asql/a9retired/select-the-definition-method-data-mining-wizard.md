# Select the Definition Method (Data Mining Wizard)
  Use the **Select the Definition Method** page to select the source for creating the new mining model. Your path through the wizard will be different depending on your selection, because a mining structure that is based on a cube requires different steps to construct than a mining structure that is based on a relational data source.  
  
 **For More information:** [Create a Relational Mining Structure](../analysis-services/data-mining/create-a-relational-mining-structure.md), [Data Mining Wizard &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../analysis-services/data-mining/data-mining-wizard-analysis-services-data-mining.md)  
  
## Options  
 **From existing relational database or data warehouse**  
 Select to create the mining model from an existing relational database or data warehouse.  
  
 **From existing cube**  
 Select to create the mining model from an existing cube.
