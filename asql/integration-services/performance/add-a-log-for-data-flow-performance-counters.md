# Add a Log for Data Flow Performance Counters
  This procedure describes how to add a log for the performance counters that the data flow engine provides.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you install [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] on a computer that is running [!INCLUDE[winxpsvr](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/winxpsvr-md.md)], and then upgrade that computer to [!INCLUDE[firstref_longhorn](../../database-engine/install/windows/includes/firstref-longhorn-md.md)], the upgrade process removes the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] performance counters from the computer. To restore the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] performance counters on the computer, run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup in repair mode.  
  
### To add logging of performance counters  
  
1.  In **Control Panel**, if you are using Classic view, click **Administrative Tools**. If you are using Category view, click **Performance and Maintenance** and then click **Administrative Tools**.  
  
2.  Click **Performance**.

4.  Click **OK**.  
  
5.  In the **MyLog** dialog box, click **Add Counters**.  
  
6.  Click **Use local computer counters** to log performance counters on the local computer, or click **Select counters from computer** and then select a computer from the list to log performance counters on the specified computer.  
  
7.  In the **Add Counters** dialog box, select **SQL Server:SSIS Pipeline** in the **Performance object** list.  
  
8.  To select performance counters, do one of the following:  
  
    -   Select **All Counters** to log all performance counters.  
  
    -   Select **Select counters in list** and select the performance counters to use.  
  
9. Click **Add**.  
  
10. Click **Close**.  
  
11. In the **MyLog** dialog box, review the list of logging performance counters in the **Counters** list.  
  
12. To add additional counters, repeat steps 5 through 10.  
  
13. Click **OK**.
