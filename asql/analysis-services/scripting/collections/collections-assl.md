# Collections (ASSL)
  This reference section contains syntax and usage information for each element that acts as a collection in the Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL) schema.  
  
 Although the ASSL schema contains only XML elements, from a developer's point of view, the elements described in this section correspond to collections of objects, such as the **Dimensions** and **Cubes** collections.  
  
 Collections are mostly collections of object elements, in which a plural noun designates the collection (for examples, **Cubes**), and the collection contains elements designated by the same noun in the singular (for example, **Cube**).  
  
 In some cases, the schema does not adhere to this general rule. For example, the **ClassifiedColumns** collection contains **ClassifiedColumnID** elements.  
  
 In other cases, a collection contains elements that correspond to object properties, not to objects. For example, the **Aliases** collection contains **Alias** properties, each of which is a simple string value.
