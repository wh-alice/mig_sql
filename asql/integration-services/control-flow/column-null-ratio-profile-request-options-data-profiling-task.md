# Column Null Ratio Profile Request Options (Data Profiling Task)
  Use the **Request Properties** pane of the **Profile Requests** page to set the options for the **Column Null Ratio Request** selected in the requests pane. A Column Null Ratio profile reports the percentage of null values in the selected column. This profile can help you identify problems in your data such as an unexpectedly high ratio of null values in a column. For example, a Column Null Ratio profile can profile a ZIP Code/Postal Code column and discover an unacceptably high percentage of missing postal codes.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The options described in this topic appear on the **Profile Requests page** of the **Data Profiling Task Editor**. For more information about this page of the editor, see [Data Profiling Task Editor &#40;Profile Requests Page&#41;](../../integration-services/control-flow/data-profiling-task-editor-profile-requests-page.md).  
  
 For more information about how to use the Data Profiling Task, see [Setup of the Data Profiling Task](../../integration-services/control-flow/setup-of-the-data-profiling-task.md). For more information about how to use the Data Profile Viewer to analyze the output of the Data Profiling Task, see [Data Profile Viewer](../../integration-services/control-flow/data-profile-viewer.md).
