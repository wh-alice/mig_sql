# Script to Grant Oracle Permissions
  The script provided in this topic is used during the configuration of an Oracle database that will publish data using [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] replication. This script is also available in the following directory after installation: *\<drive>*:\\\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\\*\<InstanceName>*\MSSQL\Install\oracleadmin.sql. For more information about configuring the Oracle database, see [Configure an Oracle Publisher](../../../relational-databases/replication/non-sql/configure-an-oracle-publisher.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This script includes the statement `GRANT CREATE ANY TRIGGER TO &&AdminLogin;`, which is required for the triggers used by transactional replication. If you will use only snapshot replication, remove this line from the script.  
  
 **To run the script from the Oracle SQL\*Plus utility**  
  
1.  On the SQL Server Distributor, open a Command Prompt window.  
  
2.  To use SQL*PLUS to connect to the Oracle database and execute the oracleadmin.sql script from its default install directory, type the following syntax:  
  
    ```  
    sqlplus system/P@$$W0rd@orcl @"c:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\<InstanceName>\MSSQL\Install\oracleadmin.sql"  
    ```  
  
     In this example, the built-in Oracle account **system** is used to connect to an Oracle database with a network name of "orcl".  
  
3.  When prompted, specify the user name, user password, and default table space.  
  
```

-- Copyright (c) 2003 Microsoft Corporation

-- File:  
--  oracleadmin.sql  
--  
-- Purpose:  
-- PL/SQL script to create a database user with the required   
-- permissions to administer SQL Server publishing for an Oracle  
-- database.  
--  
-- &&ReplLogin        == Replication user login  
-- &&ReplPassword     == Replication user password  
-- &&DefaultTablespace == Tablespace that will serve as the default  
-- tablespace for the replication user.  
-- The replication user will be authorized to allocate UNLIMITED space  
-- on the default tablespace, which must already exist.  
--  
-- Notes:  
--  
-- This script must be run from an Oracle login having the  
-- authorization to create a new user and grant unlimited tablespace on  
-- any existing tablespace. The login must also be able to grant to the  
-- newly created login the following authorizations:  
--  
-- create public synonym  
-- drop public synonym  
-- create sequence  
--  create procedure  
-- create session  
-- create table  
-- create view  
--  
-- Additionally, the following properties are also required for  
-- transactional publications.  
--  
-- create any trigger  
--  
--  All of the privileges may be granted through a role, with the  
-- exception of create table, create view, and create any trigger.  
-- These must be granted explicitly to the replication user login.  
-- In the script, all grants are granted explicitly to the replication  
-- user.  
--  
-- In addition to these general grants, a table owner must explicitly  
-- grant select authorization to the replication user on a table before  
-- the table can be published.  
--  
***********************************************************************  
  
ACCEPT ReplLogin CHAR PROMPT 'User to create for replication: ';  
ACCEPT ReplPassword CHAR PROMPT 'Replication user passsword: ' HIDE;  
ACCEPT DefaultTableSpace CHAR DEFAULT 'SYSTEM' PROMPT 'Default tablespace: ';  
  
-- Create the replication user account  
CREATE USER &&ReplLogin IDENTIFIED BY &&ReplPassword DEFAULT TABLESPACE &&DefaultTablespace QUOTA UNLIMITED ON &&DefaultTablespace;  
  
-- It is recommended that only the required grants be granted to this  
-- user.  
--  
-- The following 5 privileges are granted explicitly, but could be  
-- granted through a role.  
GRANT CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM TO &&ReplLogin;  
GRANT DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM TO &&ReplLogin;  
GRANT CREATE SEQUENCE TO &&ReplLogin;  
GRANT CREATE PROCEDURE TO &&ReplLogin;  
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO &&ReplLogin;  
  
-- The following privileges must be granted explicitly to the  
-- replication user.  
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO &&ReplLogin;  
GRANT CREATE VIEW TO &&ReplLogin;  
  
-- The replication user login needs to be able to create a tracking  
-- trigger on any table that is to be published in a transactional  
-- publication. The CREATE ANY privilege is used to obtain the  
-- authorization to create these triggers.  To replicate a table, the  
-- table owner must additionally explicitly grant select authorization  
-- on the table to the replication user.  
--  
-- NOTE: CREATE ANY TRIGGER is not required for snapshot publications.  
GRANT CREATE ANY TRIGGER TO &&ReplLogin;  
```
