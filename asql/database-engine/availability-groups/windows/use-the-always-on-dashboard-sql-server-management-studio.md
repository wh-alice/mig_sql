# Use the Always On Dashboard (SQL Server Management Studio)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Database administrators use the Always On Dashboard to obtains an at-a-glance view the health of an Always On availability group and its availability replicas and databases in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. Some of the typical uses for the Always On Dashboard are:  
  
-   Choosing a replica for a manual failover.  
  
-   Estimating data loss if you force failover.  
  
-   Evaluating data-synchronization performance.  
  
-   Evaluating the performance impact of a synchronous-commit secondary replica  
  
 The Always On Dashboard provides key availability group states and performance indicators allowing you to easily make high availability operational decisions using the following types of information.  
  
-   Replica roll-up state  
  
-   Synchronization mode and state  
  
-   Estimate Data Loss  
  
-   Estimated Recovery Time (redo catch up)  
  
-   Database Replica details  
  
-   Synchronization mode and state  
  
-   Time to restore log

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites  
 You must be connected to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (server instance) that hosts either the primary replica or a secondary replica of an availability group.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Requires CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and VIEW ANY DEFINITION permissions.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> To start the Always On Dashboard

##  <a name="AvGroupDetails"></a> Availability Group Details  
 The following detail information is displayed for the availability group that you select from the summary screen:  
  
 **Availability group state**  
 Displays the state of health for the availability group.  
  
 **Primary instance**  
 Name of the server instance that is hosting the primary replica of the availability group.

-   **Manual**. Indicates that no replica is automatic-failover mode.  
  
 **Cluster state**  
 Name and state of the cluster where the instance of the connected server and the availability group is a member node.  
  
##  <a name="AvReplicaDetails"></a> Availability Replica Details  
 The **Availability replica** pane displays the following columns:  
  
 **Name**  
 The name of the server instance that hosts the availability replica. This column is shown by default.  
  
 **Role**  
 Indicates the current role of the availability replica, either **Primary** or **Secondary**. For information about [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] roles, see [Overview of Always On Availability Groups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/overview-of-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server.md). This column is shown by default.  
  
 **Failover Mode**  
 Displays the failover mode for which the replica is configured. The possible failover mode values are:  
  
-   **Automatic**. Indicates that one or more replicas is in automatic-failover mode.  
  
-   **Manual**. Indicates that no replica is automatic-failover mode.  
  
 **Synchronization State**  
 Indicates whether a secondary replica is currently synchronized with primary replica. This column is shown by default. The possible values are:  
  
-   **Not Synchronized**. One or more databases in the replica are not synchronized or have not yet been joined to the availability group.  
  
-   **Synchronizing**. One or more databases in the replica are being synchronized.  
  
-   **Synchronized**. All databases in the secondary replica are synchronized with the corresponding primary databases on the current primary replica, if any, or on the last primary replica.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In performance mode, the database is never in the synchronized state.  
  
-   **NULL**. Unknown state. This value occurs when the local server instance cannot communicate with the WSFC failover cluster (that is the local node is not part of WSFC quorum).  
  
 **Issues**  
 Lists the issue name. This value is shown by default. For a list of all the Always On policy issues, see [Always On Policies for Operational Issues with Always On Availability Groups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../Topic/Always%20On%20Policies%20for%20Operational%20Issues%20with%20Always%20On%20Availability%20Groups%20\(SQL%20Server\).md).  
  
 **Availability Mode**  
 Indicates the replica property that that you set separately for each availability replica. This value is hidden by default. The possible values are:  
  
-   **Asynchronous**. The secondary replica never becomes synchronized with the primary replica.  
  
-   **Synchronous**. When catching up to the primary database, a secondary database enters this state, and it remains caught up as long as data synchronization continues for the database.

 Indicates whether a secondary replica is currently connected to the primary replica. This column is hidden by default. The possible values are:  
  
-   **Disconnected**. For a remote availability replica, indicates that it is disconnected from the local availability replica. The response of the local replica to the Disconnected state depends on its role, as follows:  
  
    -   On the primary replica, if a secondary replica is disconnected, the secondary databases are marked as **Not Synchronized** on the primary replica, and the primary replica waits for the secondary to reconnect.  
  
    -   On the secondary replica, upon detecting that it is disconnected, the secondary replica attempts to reconnect to the primary replica.  
  
-   **Connected**. A remote availability replica that is currently connected to the local replica.  
  
 **Operational State**  
 Indicates the current operational state of the secondary replica. This value is hidden by default. The possible values are:  
  
 **0**. Pending failover  
  
 **1**. Pending  
  
 **2**. Online  
  
 **3**. Offline  
  
 **4**. Failed  
  
 **5**. Failed, no quorum  
  
 **NULL**. Replica is not local  
  
 **Last Connection Error No.**  
 Number of the last connection error.  This value is hidden by default.  
  
 **Last Connection Error Description**  
 Description of the last connection error.  This value is hidden by default.

##  <a name="AvDbDetails"></a> To Group Availability Group Information  
 To group the information, click **Group by**, and select one of the following:  
  
-   **Availability replicas**  
  
-   **Availability databases**  
  
-   **Synchronization state**

    -   For a primary database, indicates that this database is ready to accept a scan request from a secondary database.  
  
    -   On a secondary replica, indicates that there is active data movement going on for that secondary database.  
  
     On a secondary replica, indicates that there is active data movement going on for that replica.  
  
-   **Synchronized**.  
  
     For a primary database, indicates that at least one secondary database is synchronized.  
  
     For a secondary database, indicates that the database is synchronized with the corresponding primary database.  
  
-   **Reverting**.  
  
     Indicates the phase in the undo process when a secondary database is actively getting pages from the primary database.  
  
    > [!CAUTION]  
    >  When a database is in the REVERTING state, forcing failover to the secondary replica can leave that database in a state in which it cannot be started.  
  
-   **Initializing**.  
  
     Indicates the phase of undo when the transaction log required for a secondary database to catch up to the undo LSN is being shipped and hardened on a secondary replica.  
  
    > [!CAUTION]  
    >  When a database is in the INITIALIZING state, forcing failover to the secondary replica will always leave that database in a state in which it cannot be started.  
  
 **Failover Readiness**  
 Indicates which availability replica can be failed over with or without potential data loss. This column is shown by default. The possible values are:  
  
-   **Data Loss**  
  
-   **No Data Loss**  
  
 **Issues**  
 Lists the issue name. This column is shown by default. The possible values are:  
  
-   **Warnings**. Click to display the thresholds and warnings issues.  
  
-   **Critical**. Click to display the critical issues.
