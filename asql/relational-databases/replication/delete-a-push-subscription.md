# Delete a Push Subscription
  This topic describes how to delete a push subscription in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)], or Replication Management Objects (RMO).  
  
 **In This Topic**  
  
-   **To delete a push subscription, using:**  
  
     [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMSProcedure)  
  
     [Transact-SQL](#TsqlProcedure)  
  
     [Replication Management Objects (RMO)](#RMOProcedure)  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
 Delete a push subscription at the Publisher (from the **Local Publications** folder in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]) or the Subscriber (from the **Local Subscriptions** folder). Deleting a subscription does not remove objects or data from the subscription; they must be removed manually.  
  
#### To delete a push subscription at the Publisher  
  
1.  Connect to the Publisher in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], and then expand the server node.  
  
2.  Expand the **Replication** folder, and then expand the **Local Publications** folder.  
  
3.  Expand the publication associated with the subscription you want to delete.  
  
4.  Right-click the subscription, and then click **Delete**.  
  
5.  In the confirmation dialog box, select whether to connect to the Subscriber to delete subscription information. If you clear the **Connect to Subscriber** checkbox, you should connect to the Subscriber later to delete the information.  
  
#### To delete a push subscription at the Subscriber  
  
1.  Connect to the Subscriber in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], and then expand the server node.  
  
2.  Expand the **Replication** folder, and then expand the **Local Subscriptions** folder.  
  
3.  Right-click the subscription you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.  
  
4.  In the confirmation dialog box, select whether to connect to the Publisher to delete subscription information. If you clear the **Connect to Publisher** check box, you should connect to the Publisher later to delete the information.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
 Push subscriptions can be deleted programmatically using replication stored procedures. The stored procedures used depend on the type of publication to which the subscription belongs.  
  
#### To delete a push subscription to a snapshot or transactional publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher on the publication database, execute [sp_dropsubscription &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-dropsubscription-transact-sql.md). Specify **@publication** and **@subscriber**. Specify a value of **all** for **@article**. (Optional) If the Distributor cannot be accessed, specify a value of **1** for **@ignore_distributor** to delete the subscription without removing related objects at the Distributor.  
  
2.  At the Subscriber on the subscription database, execute [sp_subscription_cleanup &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-subscription-cleanup-transact-sql.md) to remove replication metadata in the subscription database.  
  
#### To delete a push subscription to a merge publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_dropmergesubscription &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-dropmergesubscription-transact-sql.md), specifying **@publication**, **@subscriber** and **@subscriber_db**. (Optional) If the Distributor cannot be accessed, specify a value of **1** for **@ignore_distributor** to delete the subscription without removing related objects at the Distributor.  
  
2.  At the Subscriber on the subscription database, execute [sp_mergesubscription_cleanup &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-mergesubscription-cleanup-transact-sql.md). Specify **@publisher**, **@publisher_db**, and **@publication**. This removes merge metadata from the subscription database.

 This example deletes a push subscription to a merge publication.

##  <a name="RMOProcedure"></a> Using Replication Management Objects (RMO)  
 The RMO classes that you use to delete a push subscription depend on the type of publication to which the push subscription is subscribed.  
  
#### To delete a push subscription to a snapshot or transactional publication  
  
1.  Create a connection to the Subscriber by using the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> class.  
  
2.  Create an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.TransSubscription> class.  
  
3.  Set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.PublicationName%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.SubscriptionDBName%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.SubscriberName%2A>, and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.DatabaseName%2A> properties.  
  
4.  Set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> from step 1 for the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.ConnectionContext%2A> property.  
  
5.  Check the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.IsExistingObject%2A> property to verify that the subscription exists. If the value of this property is **false**, either the subscription properties in step 2 were defined incorrectly or the subscription does not exist.  
  
6.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.Remove%2A> method.

2.  Create an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.MergeSubscription> class.  
  
3.  Set the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.PublicationName%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.SubscriptionDBName%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.SubscriberName%2A>, and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.DatabaseName%2A> properties.
