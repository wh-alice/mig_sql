# View a Saved Trace (Transact-SQL)
  This topic describes how to use built-in functions to view a saved trace.  
  
### To view a specific trace  
  
1.  Execute **fn_trace_getinfo** by specifying the ID of the trace about which information is needed. This function returns a table that lists the trace, trace property, and information about the property.  
  
     Invoke the function this way:  
  
    ```  
    SELECT *  
    FROM ::fn_trace_getinfo(trace_id)  
    ```  
  
### To view all existing traces  
  
1.  Execute **fn_trace_getinfo** by specifying `0` or `default`. This function returns a table that lists all the traces, their properties, and information about these properties.  
  
     Invoke the function as follows:  
  
    ```  
    SELECT *  
    FROM ::fn_trace_getinfo(default)  
    ```  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 To run the built-in function **fn_trace_getinfo**, the user needs the following permission:  
  
 ALTER TRACE on the server.
