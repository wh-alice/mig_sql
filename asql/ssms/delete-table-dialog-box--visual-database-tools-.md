# Delete Table Dialog Box (Visual Database Tools)
This dialog box allows you to specify the table from which to delete records. This dialog box appears if more than one table is displayed in the Diagram pane when you change the type of a query to a DELETE query.  
  
Select the table to delete records from, and then choose **OK**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> A DELETE query removes entire rows from the table. If you want to clear values from individual data columns, use an UPDATE query. If you want to delete columns from a table definition, or delete the table itself, use Table Designer or the database design tools for your database.
