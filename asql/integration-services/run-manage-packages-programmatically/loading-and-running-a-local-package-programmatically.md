# Loading and Running a Local Package Programmatically
  You can run [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages as needed or at predetermined times by using the methods described in [Running Packages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms141708(v=sql.110).aspx). However, with only a few lines of code, you can also run a package from a custom application such as a Windows Forms application, a console application, an ASP.NET Web form or Web service, or a Windows service.  
  
 This topic discusses:  
  
-   Loading a package programmatically  
  
-   Running a package programmatically  
  
 All of the methods used in this topic to load and run packages require a reference to the **Microsoft.SqlServer.ManagedDTS** assembly. After adding the reference in a new project, import the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime> namespace with a **using** or **Imports** statement.  
  
## Loading a Package Programmatically  
 To load a package programmatically on the local computer, whether the package is stored locally or remotely, call one of the following methods:  
  
|Storage Location|Method to Call|  
|----------------------|--------------------|  
|File|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Application.LoadPackage%2A>|  
|SSIS Package Store|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Application.LoadFromDtsServer%2A>|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Application.LoadFromSqlServer%2A>|  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The methods of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Application> class for working with the SSIS Package Store only support ".", localhost, or the server name for the local server. You cannot use "(local)".  
  
## Running a Package Programmatically  
 Developing a custom application in managed code that runs a package on the local computer requires the following approach. The steps summarized here are demonstrated in the sample console application that follows.  
  
#### To run a package on the local computer programmatically  
  
1.  Start the Visual Studio development environment, and create a new application in your preferred development language. This example uses a console application; however you can also run a package from a Windows Forms application, an ASP.NET Web form or Web service, or a Windows service.  
  
2.  On the **Project** menu, click **Add Reference** and add a reference to **Microsoft.SqlServer.ManagedDTS.dll**. Click **OK**.  
  
3.  Use the Visual Basic **Imports** statement or the C# **using** statement to import the **Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime** namespace.  
  
4.  Add the following code in the main routine. The completed console application should look like the following example.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The sample code demonstrates loading the package from the file system by using the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Application.LoadPackage%2A> method. However you can also load the package from the MSDB database by calling the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Application.LoadFromSqlServer%2A> method, or from the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] package store by calling the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Application.LoadFromDtsServer%2A> method.  
  
5.  Run the project. The sample code executes the CalculatedColumns sample package that is installed with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] samples. The result of package execution is displayed in the console window.  
  
### Sample Code  
  
```vb#  
Imports Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime  
  
Module Module1  
  
  Sub Main()  
  
    Dim pkgLocation As String  
    Dim pkg As New Package  
    Dim app As New Application  
    Dim pkgResults As DTSExecResult  
  
    pkgLocation = _  
      "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Samples\Integration Services" & _  
      "\Package Samples\CalculatedColumns Sample\CalculatedColumns\CalculatedColumns.dtsx"  
    pkg = app.LoadPackage(pkgLocation, Nothing)  
    pkgResults = pkg.Execute()  
  
    Console.WriteLine(pkgResults.ToString())  
    Console.ReadKey()  
  
  End Sub  
  
End Module  
```  
  
```c#  
using System;  
using Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime;  
  
namespace RunFromClientAppCS  
{  
  class Program  
  {  
    static void Main(string[] args)  
    {  
      string pkgLocation;  
      Package pkg;  
      Application app;  
      DTSExecResult pkgResults;  
  
      pkgLocation =  
        @"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Samples\Integration Services" +  
        @"\Package Samples\CalculatedColumns Sample\CalculatedColumns\CalculatedColumns.dtsx";  
      app = new Application();  
      pkg = app.LoadPackage(pkgLocation, null);  
      pkgResults = pkg.Execute();  
  
      Console.WriteLine(pkgResults.ToString());  
      Console.ReadKey();  
    }  
  }  
}  
```  
  
## Capturing Events from a Running Package  
 When you run a package programmatically as shown in the preceding sample, you may also want to capture errors and other events that occur as the package executes. You can accomplish this by adding a class that inherits from the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DefaultEvents> class, and by passing a reference to that class when you load the package. Although the following example captures only the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DefaultEvents.OnError%2A> event, there are many other events that the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DefaultEvents> class lets you capture.  
  
#### To run a package on the local computer programmatically and capture package events  
  
1.  Follow the steps in the preceding example to create a project for this example.  
  
2.  Add the following code in the main routine. The completed console application should look like the following example.  
  
3.  Run the project. The sample code executes the CalculatedColumns sample package that is installed with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] samples. The result of package execution is displayed in the console window, along with any errors that occur.  
  
### Sample Code  
  
```vb#  
Imports Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime  
  
Module Module1  
  
  Sub Main()  
  
    Dim pkgLocation As String  
    Dim pkg As New Package  
    Dim app As New Application  
    Dim pkgResults As DTSExecResult  
  
    Dim eventListener As New EventListener()  
  
    pkgLocation = _  
      "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Samples\Integration Services" & _  
      "\Package Samples\CalculatedColumns Sample\CalculatedColumns\CalculatedColumns.dtsx"  
    pkg = app.LoadPackage(pkgLocation, eventListener)  
    pkgResults = pkg.Execute(Nothing, Nothing, eventListener, Nothing, Nothing)  
  
    Console.WriteLine(pkgResults.ToString())  
    Console.ReadKey()  
  
  End Sub  
  
End Module  
  
Class EventListener  
  Inherits DefaultEvents  
  
  Public Overrides Function OnError(ByVal source As Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DtsObject, _  
    ByVal errorCode As Integer, ByVal subComponent As String, ByVal description As String, _  
    ByVal helpFile As String, ByVal helpContext As Integer, _  
    ByVal idofInterfaceWithError As String) As Boolean  
  
    ' Add applicationâ€“specific diagnostics here.  
    Console.WriteLine("Error in {0}/{1} : {2}", source, subComponent, description)  
    Return False  
  
  End Function  
  
End Class  
```  
  
```c#  
using System;  
using Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime;  
  
namespace RunFromClientAppWithEventsCS  
{  
  class MyEventListener : DefaultEvents  
  {  
    public override bool OnError(DtsObject source, int errorCode, string subComponent,   
      string description, string helpFile, int helpContext, string idofInterfaceWithError)  
    {  
      // Add application-specific diagnostics here.  
      Console.WriteLine("Error in {0}/{1} : {2}", source, subComponent, description);  
      return false;  
    }  
  }  
  class Program  
  {  
    static void Main(string[] args)  
    {  
      string pkgLocation;  
      Package pkg;  
      Application app;  
      DTSExecResult pkgResults;  
  
      MyEventListener eventListener = new MyEventListener();  
  
      pkgLocation =  
        @"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Samples\Integration Services" +  
        @"\Package Samples\CalculatedColumns Sample\CalculatedColumns\CalculatedColumns.dtsx";  
      app = new Application();  
      pkg = app.LoadPackage(pkgLocation, eventListener);  
      pkgResults = pkg.Execute(null, null, eventListener, null, null);  
  
      Console.WriteLine(pkgResults.ToString());  
      Console.ReadKey();  
    }  
  }  
}  
```
