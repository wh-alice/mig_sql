# sys.column_store_row_groups (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2014-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../integration-services/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2014-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Provides clustered columnstore index information on a per-segment basis to help the administrator make system management decisions. **sys.column_store_row_groups** has a column for the total number of rows physically stored (including those marked as deleted) and a column for the number of rows marked as deleted. Use **sys.column_store_row_groups** to determine which row groups have a high percentage of deleted rows and should be rebuilt.  
   
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**object_id**|**int**|The id of the table on which this index is defined.|  
|**index_id**|**int**|ID of the index for the table that has this columnstore index.|  
|**partition_number**|**int**|ID of the table partition that holds row group row_group_id. You can use partition_number to join this DMV to sys.partitions.|  
|**row_group_id**|**int**|The row group number associated with this row group. This is unique within the partition.<br /><br /> -1 = tail of an in-memory table.|  
|**delta_store_hobt_id**|**bigint**|The hobt_id for OPEN row group in the delta store.<br /><br /> NULL if the row group is not in the delta store.<br /><br /> NULL for the tail of an in-memory table.|  
|**state**|**tinyint**|ID number associated with the state_description.<br /><br /> 0 = INVISIBLE<br /><br /> 1 = OPEN<br /><br /> 2 = CLOSED<br /><br /> 3 = COMPRESSED <br /><br /> 4 = TOMBSTONE|  
|**state_description**|**nvarchar(60)**|Description of the persistent state of the row group:<br /><br /> INVISIBLE –A hidden compressed segment in the process of being built from data in a delta store. Read actions will use the delta store until the invisible compressed segment is completed. Then the new segment is made visible, and the source delta store is removed.<br /><br /> OPEN – A read/write row group that is accepting new records. An open row group is still in rowstore format and has not been compressed to columnstore format.<br /><br /> CLOSED – A row group that has been filled, but not yet compressed by the tuple mover process.<br /><br /> COMPRESSED – A row group that has filled and compressed.|  
|**total_rows**|**bigint**|Total rows physically stored in the row group. Some may have been deleted but they are still stored. The maximum number of rows in a row group is 1,048,576 (hexadecimal FFFFF).|  
|**deleted_rows**|**bigint**|Total rows in the row group marked deleted. This is always 0 for DELTA row groups.|  
|**size_in_bytes**|**bigint**|Size in bytes of all the data in this row group (not including metadata or shared dictionaries), for both DELTA and COLUMNSTORE rowgroups.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Returns one row for each columnstore row group for each table having a clustered or nonclustered columnstore index.  
  
 Use **sys.column_store_row_groups** to determine the number of rows included in the row group and the size of the row group.  
  
 When the number of deleted rows in a row group grows to a large percentage of the total rows, the table becomes less efficient. Rebuild the columnstore index to reduce the size of the table, reducing the disk I/O required to read the table. To rebuild the columnstore index use the **REBUILD** option of the **ALTER INDEX** statement.  
  
 The updateable columnstore first inserts new data into an **OPEN** rowgroup, which is in rowstore format, and is also sometimes referred to as a delta table.  Once an open rowgroup is full, its state changes to **CLOSED**. A closed rowgroup is compressed into columnstore format by the tuple mover and the state changes to **COMPRESSED**.  The tuple mover is a background process that periodically wakes up and checks whether there are any closed rowgroups that are ready to compress into a columnstore rowgroup.  The tuple mover also deallocates any rowgroups in which every row has been deleted. Deallocated rowgroups are marked as **TOMBSTONE**. To run tuple mover immediately, use the **REORGANIZE** option of the **ALTER INDEX** statement.  
  
 When a columnstore row group has filled, it is compressed, and stops accepting new rows. When rows are deleted from a compressed group, they remain but are marked as deleted. Updates to a compressed group are implemented as a delete from the compressed group, and an insert to an open group.  
  
## Permissions  
 Returns information for a table if the user has **VIEW DEFINITION** permission on the table.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssCatViewPerm](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/includes/sscatviewperm-md.md)] For more information, see [Metadata Visibility Configuration](../../../relational-databases/security/metadata-visibility-configuration.md).  
  
## Examples  
 The following example joins the **sys.column_store_row_groups** table to other system tables to return information about specific tables. The calculated `PercentFull` column is an estimate of the efficiency of the row group. To find information on a single table remove the comment hyphens in front of the **WHERE** clause and provide a table name.  
  
```  
SELECT i.object_id, object_name(i.object_id) AS TableName,   
i.name AS IndexName, i.index_id, i.type_desc,   
CSRowGroups.*,   
100*(total_rows - ISNULL(deleted_rows,0))/total_rows AS PercentFull    
FROM sys.indexes AS i  
JOIN sys.column_store_row_groups AS CSRowGroups  
    ON i.object_id = CSRowGroups.object_id  
AND i.index_id = CSRowGroups.index_id   
--WHERE object_name(i.object_id) = '<table_name>'   
ORDER BY object_name(i.object_id), i.name, row_group_id;  
```
