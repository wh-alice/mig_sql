# Mining Structure Tasks and How-tos
  The **Mining Structure** tab of Data Mining Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] contains tools that you can use to create, edit, and process a mining structure.  
  
## In This Section  
  
-   [Create a New Relational Mining Structure](../../analysis-services/data-mining/create-a-new-relational-mining-structure.md)  
  
-   [Create a New OLAP Mining Structure](../../analysis-services/data-mining/create-a-new-olap-mining-structure.md)  
  
-   [Add Columns to a Mining Structure](../../analysis-services/data-mining/add-columns-to-a-mining-structure.md)  
  
-   [Remove Columns from a Mining Structure](../../analysis-services/data-mining/remove-columns-from-a-mining-structure.md)  
  
-   [Add a Nested Table to a Mining Structure](../../analysis-services/data-mining/add-a-nested-table-to-a-mining-structure.md)
