# DENY Object Permissions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Denies permissions on a member of the OBJECT class of securables. These are the members of the OBJECT class: tables, views, table-valued functions, stored procedures, extended stored procedures, scalar functions, aggregate functions, service queues, and synonyms.  

  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
DENY <permission> [ ,...n ] ON   
    [ OBJECT :: ][ schema_name ]. object_name [ ( column [ ,...n ] ) ]  
        TO <database_principal> [ ,...n ]   
    [ CASCADE ]  
        [ AS <database_principal> ]  
  
<permission> ::=  
    ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] | permission [ ( column [ ,...n ] ) ]  
  
<database_principal> ::=   
        Database_user   
    | Database_role   
    | Application_role   
    | Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_User   
    | Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_Group   
    | Database_user_mapped_to_certificate   
    | Database_user_mapped_to_asymmetric_key   
    | Database_user_with_no_login  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be denied on a schema-contained object. For a list of the permissions, see the Remarks section later in this topic.  
  
 ALL  
 Denying ALL does not deny all possible permissions. Denying ALL is equivalent to denying all ANSI-92 permissions applicable to the specified object. The meaning of ALL varies as follows:  
  
 Scalar function permissions: EXECUTE, REFERENCES.  
  
 Table-valued function permissions: DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, UPDATE.  
  
 Stored Procedure permissions: EXECUTE.  
  
 Table permissions: DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, UPDATE.  
  
 View permissions: DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, UPDATE.  
  
 PRIVILEGES  
 Included for ANSI-92 compliance. Does not change the behavior of ALL.  
  
 *column*  
 Specifies the name of a column in a table, view, or table-valued function on which the permission is being denied. The parentheses **( )** are required. Only SELECT, REFERENCES, and UPDATE permissions can be denied on a column. *column* can be specified in the permissions clause or after the securable name.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  A table-level DENY does not take precedence over a column-level GRANT. This inconsistency in the permissions hierarchy has been preserved for backward compatibility.  
  
 ON [ OBJECT **::** ] [ *schema_name* ] **.** *object_name*  
 Specifies the object on which the permission is being denied. The OBJECT phrase is optional if *schema_name* is specified. If the OBJECT phrase is used, the scope qualifier (**::**) is required. If *schema_name* is not specified, the default schema is used. If *schema_name* is specified, the schema scope qualifier (**.**) is required.  
  
 TO <database_principal>  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is being denied.  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being denied is also denied to other principals to which it has been granted by this principal.  
  
 AS <database_principal>  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to deny the permission.  
  
 *Database_user*  
 Specifies a database user.  
  
 *Database_role*  
 Specifies a database role.  
  
 *Application_role*  
 Specifies an application role.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_User*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a Windows user.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_Group*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a Windows group.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_certificate*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a certificate.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_asymmetric_key*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to an asymmetric key.  
  
 *Database_user_with_no_login*  
 Specifies a database user with no corresponding server-level principal.  
  
## Remarks  
 Information about objects is visible in various catalog views. For more information, see [Object Catalog Views &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/object-catalog-views-transact-sql.md).  
  
 An object is a schema-level securable contained by the schema that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on an object are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Object permission|Implied by object permission|Implied by schema permission|  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|DELETE|CONTROL|DELETE|  
|EXECUTE|CONTROL|EXECUTE|  
|INSERT|CONTROL|INSERT|  
|RECEIVE|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|SELECT|RECEIVE|SELECT|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|UPDATE|CONTROL|UPDATE|  
|VIEW CHANGE TRACKING|CONTROL|VIEW CHANGE TRACKING|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the object.  
  
 If you use the AS clause, the specified principal must own the object on which permissions are being denied.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Denying SELECT permission on a table  
 The following example denies `SELECT` permission to the user `RosaQdM` on the table `Person.Address` in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
DENY SELECT ON OBJECT::Person.Address TO RosaQdM;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Denying EXECUTE permission on a stored procedure  
 The following example denies `EXECUTE` permission on the stored procedure `HumanResources.uspUpdateEmployeeHireInfo` to an application role called `Recruiting11`.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
DENY EXECUTE ON OBJECT::HumanResources.uspUpdateEmployeeHireInfo  
    TO Recruiting11;  
GO   
```  
  
### C. Denying REFERENCES permission on a view with CASCADE  
 The following example denies `REFERENCES` permission on the column `BusinessEntityID` in the view `HumanResources.vEmployee` to the user `Wanida` with `CASCADE`.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
DENY REFERENCES (BusinessEntityID) ON OBJECT::HumanResources.vEmployee   
    TO Wanida CASCADE;  
GO  
```
