# geography Data Type Method Reference
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports a set of methods for the **geography** spatial data type, including methods on geography that are defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard and a set of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] extensions to that standard.  
  
 The error tolerance for the **geography** methods can be as large as 1.0e-7 \* extents. The extents refer to the approximate maximal distance between points of the **geography**object.
