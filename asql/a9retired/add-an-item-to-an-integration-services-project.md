2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the project, point to **Add**, and do one of the following:  
  
    -   Click **New Item**, and then select a template from the **Templates** pane in the **Add New Item** dialog box.  
  
    -   Click **Existing Item**, browse in the **Add Existing Item** dialog box to locate the item you want to add to the project, and then click **Add**.
