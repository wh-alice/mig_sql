# Remote Blob Store (RBS) and Always On Availability Groups (SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] can provide a high-availability and disaster recovery solution for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)][Remote Blob Store (RBS)](../../../relational-databases/blob/remote-blob-store-rbs-sql-server.md) BLOB objects (blobs). [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] protects any RBS metadata and schemas stored in an availability database by replicating them to the secondary replicas. This is the SharePoint Content Database. Generally speaking, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] stores this RBS metadata independently from the blob.  
  
 The protection for RBS BLOB data depends on the BLOB Store Location, as follows:  
  
|BLOB Store Location|Can Availability Groups Protect This BLOB Data?|  
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
|The same database that contains the RBS metadata  (stored using a RBS remote FILESTREAM provider)|Yes|  
|Another database in the same instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (stored using a RBS remote FILESTREAM provider)|Yes<br /><br /> We recommend that you put this database in the same availability group as the database that contains the RBS metadata.|  
|Another database in a different instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (stored using a RBS remote FILESTREAM provider)|Yes<br /><br /> This database must be in a separate availability group.|  
|A third-party BLOB store|No<br /><br /> To protect this BLOB data, use the high-availability mechanisms of the BLOB store provider.|  
  
##  <a name="Limitations"></a> Limitations  
  
-   RBS maintainers need to be targeted on the primary replica.  
  
##  <a name="Recommendations"></a> Recommendations  
  
-   Use an availability group listener. For more information, see [Availability Group Listeners, Client Connectivity, and Application Failover &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/listeners-client-connectivity-application-failover.md).
