# MDX Data Definition - ALTER CUBE
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Alters the structure of a specified cube, typically used to support dimension writeback. For more information about using writeback in an application, see this blog post: [Building a Writeback Application with Analysis Services (blog)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394977)  
  
 Note that concurrent dimension writebacks can result in a deadlock, where the first writeback is blocked from a commit because of the shared lock held by the second writeback. There is no error that is generated in this situation, but neither operation is able to progress. Eventually both time out and the changes are rolled back.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```

<create dimension member clause> ::=

```  
  
## Creating a Dimension Member  
 A new row is added to the underlying dimension table.  
  
### Arguments  
 *ParentName*  
 A valid string expression that provides the name of the parent of the new dimension member, unless the dimension member is being created at the root.  
  
 *MemberName*  
 A valid string expression that provides a member name.  
  
 *Key_Value*  
 A valid scalar expression that defines the new dimension member's key value.  
  
 *Property_Name*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) identifier that represents a member property.  
  
 *Property_Value*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) scalar expression that defines the calculated member property's value.  
  
## Dropping a Dimension Member  
 Dropping a dimension member from a write-enabled dimension deletes the member and its corresponding row from the underlying dimension table.  
  
### Arguments  
 *Cube_Name*  
 A valid string expression providing a cube name.  
  
 *Member_Name*  
 A valid string expression providing a member name or member key.  
  
### Remarks  
 If the WITH DESCENDANTS clause is not used, children of a dropped member become children of the dropped member's parent. If the WITH DESCENDANTS clause is used, all descendants and their rows in the dimension table are also dropped.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For information about dropping calculated members, named sets, actions, and cell calculations, see [DROP MEMBER Statement &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/mdx-data-definition-drop-member.md), [DROP SET Statement &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/mdx-data-definition-drop-set.md), [DROP ACTION Statement &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/mdx-data-definition-drop-action.md), and [DROP CELL CALCULATION Statement &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/mdx-data-definition-drop-cell-calculation.md).  
  
## Updating the Default Dimension Member  
 This clause updates the default member of a cube and is used in the MDX calculation script to define a default member. The default member can be specified for the database dimension, a cube dimension, or for a user's login. The default member can also be changed during a session.  
  
### Arguments  
 *Dimension_Name*  
 A valid string that provides the name of a dimension.  
  
 *MDX_Expression*  
 A valid MDX expression that returns a single member.  
  
### Remarks  
 The specified MDX expression can be static or dynamic.  
  
## Moving a Dimension Member  
 A row is modified in the underlying dimension table.  
  
### Arguments  
 *ParentName*  
 A valid string expression that provides the name of the new parent for the dimension member being moved.  
  
 *MemberName*  
 A valid string expression that provides a member name.  
  
 Unsigned_*Integer*  
 A valid number specifying the number of levels to skip.  
  
 If the WITH DESCENDANTS clause is specified, the entire tree is moved. If the WITH DESCENDANTS clause is not specified, the children of a moved parent become the children of the moved member's parent. The effect of a move is simply to update the values for the parent key column in the underlying dimension table.  
  
## Updating a Dimension Member  
 The UPDATE DIMENSION MEMBER clause allows you to modify properties of a member as well as the custom member formula associated with a member.  
  
### Arguments  
 *MemberName*  
 A valid string expression that provides a member name.  
  
 *MDX_Expression*  
 A valid MDX expression that returns a single member.  
  
 *Property_Value*  
 A valid MDX scalar expression that defines the calculated member property's value.
