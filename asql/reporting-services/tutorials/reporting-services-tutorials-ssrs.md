# Reporting Services Tutorials (SSRS)
Explore the capabilities of [!INCLUDE[ssRSCurrent_md](../../reporting-services/includes/ssrscurrent-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull_md](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], and Report Builder with sample data in these tutorials.  
  
  
## [Create a Basic Table Report](../../reporting-services/tutorials/create-a-basic-table-report-ssrs-tutorial.md)  
Follow the steps in this tutorial to learn how to create your first report. This tutorial shows you how to work with [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to create a data connection (data source), define a simple query (dataset), and configure a data region to contain your data.  
  
## [Create a Data-Driven Subscription](../../reporting-services/tutorials/create-a-data-driven-subscription-ssrs-tutorial.md)  
[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] provides data-driven subscriptions so that you can customize the distribution of a report based on dynamic list of subscribers that will receive the report. Data-driven subscriptions are typically created and maintained by report server administrators. The ability to create data-driven subscriptions requires expertise in building queries, knowledge of data sources that contain subscriber data, and elevated permissions on a report server.
