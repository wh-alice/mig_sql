# Interactive Sort, Document Maps, and Links (Report Builder and SSRS)
  In Web-based environments, you can add a number of features that let your users interact with reports. Your users can change the sort order of values in your report, show or hide items in the report, or click links that go to other reports or Web pages. You can also add a table of contents or document map. Your report users can click items in the table of contents or document map to jump to areas within a report.  
  
 Report Builder and Report Designer support three types of links with the following actions:  
  
-   **Bookmark links** Jump to other areas within the report.  
  
-   **Hyperlinks** Jump to URLs that specify the address of Web pages or reports on a report server by using URL access.  
  
-   **Drillthrough report links** Jump to other reports on the same report server. For more information, see [Drillthrough Reports &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/drillthrough-reports-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Links that are bound to dataset fields can be vulnerable to tampering for malicious purposes. For more information, see [Secure Reports and Resources](../../reporting-services/security/secure-reports-and-resources.md) in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)][Books Online](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154888) on msdn.microsoft.com.  
  
 You can also let your users control report display and content by designing expressions that include parameter references for sort, filter, and visibility. For more information, see [Report Parameters &#40;Report Builder and Report Designer&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/report-parameters-report-builder-and-report-designer.md), [Filter, Group, and Sort Data &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/filter-group-and-sort-data-report-builder-and-ssrs.md), and [Add Dataset Filters, Data Region Filters, and Group Filters &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/fcca7243-a702-4725-8e6f-cf118e988acf.md).
