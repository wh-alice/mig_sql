# Add a User (Master Data Services)
  Add a user to the **Users** list in [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] to begin the process of assigning permission to the Web application. Before a user in the list can access [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], you must give the user permission to one or more functional areas and model objects.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Users and Group Permissions** functional area.  
  
### To add a user  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **User and Group Permissions**.  
  
2.  On the **Users** page, click **Add users**.  
  
3.  Type the user's name preceded by the Active Directory domain name or by the server computer's name, as in *domain*\\*user_name* or *computer\user_name*.  
  
4.  Optionally, click **Check names**.  
  
5.  Click **OK**.
