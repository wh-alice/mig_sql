# Use the Fail Over Availability Group Wizard (SQL Server Management Studio)
  This topic describes how to perform a planned manual failover or forced manual failover (forced failover) on an Always On availability group by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)], or PowerShell in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. An availability group fails over at the level of an availability replica. If you fail over to a secondary replica in the SYNCHRONIZED state, the wizard performs a planned manual failover (without data loss). If you fail over to a secondary replica in the UNSYNCHRONIZED or NOT SYNCHRONIZING state, the wizard performs a forced manual failover—also known as a *forced failover* (with possible data loss). Both forms of manual failover transition the secondary replica to which you are connected to the primary role. A planned manual failover currently transitions the former primary replica to the secondary role. After a forced failover, when the former primary replAica comes online, it transitions to the secondary role.

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
 Before your first planned manual failover, see the "Before You Begin" section in [Perform a Planned Manual Failover of an Availability Group &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/perform-a-planned-manual-failover-of-an-availability-group-sql-server.md).  
  
 Before your first forced failover, see the "Before You Begin" and "Follow Up: Essential Tasks After a Forced Failover" sections in [Perform a Forced Manual Failover of an Availability Group &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/perform-a-forced-manual-failover-of-an-availability-group-sql-server.md).  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   A failover command returns as soon as the target secondary replica has accepted the command. However, database recovery occurs asynchronously after the availability group has finished failing over.  
  
-   Cross-database consistency across databases within the availability group might not be maintained on failover.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Support for cross-database and distributed transactions vary by SQL Server and operating system versions. For more information, see [Cross-Database Transactions and Distributed Transactions for Always On Availability Groups and Database Mirroring &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/transactions-always-on-availability-and-database-mirroring.md).  
  
###  <a name="Prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites for Using the Failover Availability Group Wizard  
  
-   You must be connected to the server instance that hosts an availability replica that is currently available.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Requires ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP permission on the availability group, CONTROL AVAILABILITY GROUP permission, ALTER ANY AVAILABILITY GROUP permission, or CONTROL SERVER permission.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
 **To Use the Failover Availability Group Wizard**  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, connect to the server instance that hosts a secondary replica of the availability group that needs to be failed over, and expand the server tree.  
  
2.  Expand the **Always On High Availability** node and the **Availability Groups** node.  
  
3.  To launch the Failover Availability Group Wizard, right-click the availability group that you are going to fail over, and select **Failover**.  
  
4.  The information presented by the **Introduction** page depends on whether any secondary replica is eligible for a planned failover. If this page says, "**Perform a planned failover for this availability group**", you can failover the availability group without data loss.  
  
5.  On the **Select New Primary Replica** page, you can view the status of the current primary replica and of the WSFC quorum, before you choose the secondary replica that will become the new primary replica (the *failover target*). For a planned manual failover, be sure to select a secondary replica whose **Failover Readiness** value is "**No data loss**". For a forced failover, for all the possible failover targets, this value will be “**Data loss, Warnings(***#***)**”, where *#* indicates the number of warnings that exist for a given secondary replica. To view the warnings for a given failover target, click its “Failover Readiness” value.  
  
     For more information, see [Select New Primary Replica page](#SelectNewPrimaryReplica), later in this topic.  
  
6.  On the **Connect to Replica** page,  connect to the failover target. For more information, see [Connect to Replica page](#ConnectToReplica), later in this topic.  
  
7.  If you are performing a forced failover, the wizard displays the **Confirm Potential Data Loss** page. To proceed with the failover, you must select **Click here to confirm failover with potential data loss**. For more information, see .[Confirm Potential Data Loss page](#ConfirmPotentialDataLoss), later in this topic.  
  
8.  On the **Summary** page, review the implications of failing over to the selected secondary replica.  
  
     If you are satisfied with your selections, optionally click **Script** to create a script of the steps the wizard will execute. Then, to failover the availability group to the selected secondary replica, click **Finish**.  
  
9. The **Progress** page displays the progress of failing over the availability group.  
  
10. When the failover operation finishes, the **Results** page displays the result. When the wizard completes, click **Close** to exit.  
  
     For more information, see [Results Page &#40;Always On Availability Group Wizards&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/results-page-always-on-availability-group-wizards.md).  
  
11. After a forced failover, see the "Follow Up: After a Forced Failover" section in the [Perform a Forced Manual Failover of an Availability Group &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/perform-a-forced-manual-failover-of-an-availability-group-sql-server.md).

###  <a name="SelectNewPrimaryReplica"></a> Select New Primary Replica Page  
 This section describes the options of the **Select New Primary Replica** page. Use this page to select the secondary replica (failover target) to which the availability group will fail over. This replica will become the new primary replica.  
  
#### Page Options  
 **Current Primary Replica**  
 Displays the name of the current primary replica, if it is online.  
  
 **Primary Replica Status**  
 Displays the status of the current primary replica, if it is online.  
  
 **Quorum Status**  
 Displays the WSFC quorum status for the availability replica, one of:  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Normal quorum**|The cluster has started with normal quorum.|  
|**Forced quorum**|The cluster has started with forced quorum.|  
|**Unknown quorum**|The cluster quorum status is unavailable.|  
|**Not applicable**|The node that hosts the availability replica has no quorum.|  
  
 For more information, see [WSFC Quorum Modes and Voting Configuration &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../sql-server/failover-clusters/windows/wsfc-quorum-modes-and-voting-configuration-sql-server.md).  
  
 **Choose a new primary replica**  
 Use this grid to select a secondary replica to become the new primary replica. The columns in this grid are as follows:  
  
 **Server Instance**  
 Displays the name of a server instance that hosts a secondary replica.  
  
 **Availability Mode**  
 Displays the availability mode of the server instance, one of:  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Synchronous commit**|Under synchronous-commit mode, before committing transactions, a synchronous-commit primary replica waits for a synchronous-commit secondary replica to acknowledge that it has finished hardening the log. Synchronous-commit mode ensures that once a given secondary database is synchronized with the primary database, committed transactions are fully protected.|  
|**Asynchronous commit**|Under asynchronous-commit mode, the primary replica commits transactions without waiting for acknowledgement that an asynchronous-commit secondary replica has hardened the log. Asynchronous-commit mode minimizes transaction latency on the secondary databases but allows them to lag behind the primary databases, making some data loss possible.|  
  
 For more information, see [Availability Modes &#40;Always On Availability Groups&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-modes-always-on-availability-groups.md).  
  
 **Failover Mode**  
 Displays the failover mode of the server instance, one of:  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Automatic**|A secondary replica that is configured for automatic failover also supports planned manual failover whenever the secondary replica is synchronized with the primary replica.|  
|**Manual**|Two types of manual failover exist: planned (without data loss) and forced (with possible data loss). For a given secondary replica, only one of these is supported, depending on the availability mode and, for synchronous-commit mode, the synchronization state of the secondary replica. To determine which form of manual failover is currently supported by a given secondary replica, see the **Failover Readiness** column of this grid.|  
  
 For more information, see [Failover and Failover Modes &#40;Always On Availability Groups&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/failover-and-failover-modes-always-on-availability-groups.md).  
  
 **Failover Readiness**  
 Displays failover readiness of the secondary replica, one of:  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**No data loss**|This secondary replica currently supports planned failover. This value occurs only when a synchronous-commit mode secondary replica is currently synchronized with the primary replica.|  
|**Data loss, Warnings(** *#* **)**|This secondary replica currently supports forced failover (with possible data loss). This value occurs whenever the secondary replica is not synchronized with the primary replica. Click the data-loss warnings link for information about the possible data loss.|
