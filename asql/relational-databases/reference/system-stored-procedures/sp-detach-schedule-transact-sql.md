# sp_detach_schedule (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Removes an association between a schedule and a job.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../../a9notintoc/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_detach_schedule   
     { [ @job_id = ] job_id | [ @job_name = ] 'job_name' } ,  
       { [ @schedule_id = ] schedule_id | [ @schedule_name = ] 'schedule_name' } ,  
     [ @delete_unused_schedule = ] delete_unused_schedule   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@job_id=** ] *job_id*  
 The job identification number of the job to remove the schedule from. *job_id* is **uniqueidentifier**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@job_name=** ] **'***job_name***'**  
 The name of the job to remove the schedule from. *job_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Either *job_id* or *job_name* must be specified, but both cannot be specified.  
  
 [ **@schedule_id=** ] *schedule_id*  
 The schedule identification number of the schedule to remove from the job. *schedule_id* is **int**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@schedule_name=** ] **'***schedule_name***'**  
 The name of the schedule to remove from the job. *schedule_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Either *schedule_id* or *schedule_name* must be specified, but both cannot be specified.  
  
 [ **@delete_unused_schedule=** ] *delete_unused_schedule*  
 Specifies whether to delete unused job schedules. *delete_unused_schedule* is **bit**, with a default of **0**, which means that all schedules will be kept, even if no jobs reference them. If set to **1**, unused job schedules are deleted if no jobs reference them.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Result Sets  
 None  
  
## Permissions  
 By default, members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can execute this stored procedure. Other users must be granted one of the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent fixed database roles in the **msdb** database:  
  
-   **SQLAgentUserRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentReaderRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentOperatorRole**  
  
 Note that the job owner can attach a job to a schedule and detach a job from a schedule without also having to be the schedule owner. However, a schedule cannot be deleted if the detach would leave it with no jobs unless the caller is the schedule owner.  
  
 For details about the permissions of these roles, see [SQL Server Agent Fixed Database Roles](../Topic/SQL%20Server%20Agent%20Fixed%20Database%20Roles.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] checks to determine whether the user owns the schedule. Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can detach schedules from jobs owned by another user.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example removes an association between a `'NightlyJobs'` schedule and a `'BackupDatabase'` job.  
  
```  
USE msdb ;  
GO  
  
EXEC dbo.sp_detach_schedule  
    @job_name = 'BackupDatabase',  
    @schedule_name = 'NightlyJobs' ;  
GO  
```
