# sp_addlogreader_agent (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Adds a Log Reader agent for a given database. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When configuring a Publisher with a remote Distributor, the values supplied for all parameters, including *job_login* and *job_password*, are sent to the Distributor as plain text. You should encrypt the connection between the Publisher and its remote Distributor before executing this stored procedure. For more information, see [Enable Encrypted Connections to the Database Engine &#40;SQL Server Configuration Manager&#41;](../Topic/Enable%20Encrypted%20Connections%20to%20the%20Database%20Engine%20\(SQL%20Server%20Configuration%20Manager\).md).

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_addlogreader_agent [ @job_login = ] 'job_login'  
        , [ @job_password = ] 'job_password'  
    [ , [ @job_name = ] 'job_name' ]  
    [ , [ @publisher_security_mode = ] publisher_security_mode ]  
    [ , [ @publisher_login = ] 'publisher_login' ]  
    [ , [ @publisher_password = ] 'publisher_password' ]   
    [ , [ @publisher = ] 'publisher' ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@job_login**= ] **'***job_login***'**  
 Is the login for the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows account under which the agent runs. *job_login* is **nvarchar(257)**, with a default value of NULL. This Windows account is always used for agent connections to the Distributor.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For non-[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Publishers, this must be the same login specified in [sp_adddistpublisher &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-adddistpublisher-transact-sql.md).  
  
 [ **@job_password**= ] **'***job_password***'**  
 Is the password for the Windows account under which the agent runs. *job_password* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Do not store authentication information in script files. For best security, login names and passwords should be supplied at runtime.  
  
 [ **@job_name**= ] **'***job_name***'**  
 Is the name of an existing agent job. *job_name* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL. This parameter is only specified when the agent is started using an existing job instead of a newly created job (the default).  
  
 [ **@publisher_security_mode**= ] *publisher_security_mode*  
 Is the security mode used by the agent when connecting to the Publisher. *publisher_security_mode* is **smallint**, with a default of **1**. **0** specifies [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication, and **1** specifies Windows Authentication. A value of **0** must be specified for non-[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Publishers.  
  
 [ **@publisher_login**= ] **'***publisher_login***'**  
 Is the login used when connecting to the Publisher. *publisher_login* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL. *publisher_login* must be specified when *publisher_security_mode* is **0**. If *publisher_login* is NULL and *publisher_security_mode* is **1**, then the Windows account specified in *job_login* will be used when connecting to the Publisher.  
  
 [ **@publisher_password**= ] **'***publisher_password***'**  
 Is the password used when connecting to the Publisher. *publisher_password* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Do not store authentication information in script files. For best security, login names and passwords should be supplied at runtime.  
  
 [ **@publisher**= ] **'***publisher***'**  
 Is the name of the non-[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Publisher. *publisher* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You should not specify this parameter for a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Publisher.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_addlogreader_agent** is used in transactional replication.  
  
 You must execute **sp_addlogreader_agent** to add a Log Reader agent if you upgraded a database that was enabled for replication to this version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] before a publication was created that used the database.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role or the **db_owner** fixed database role can execute **sp_addlogreader_agent**.
