# Properties Window F1 Help (Management Studio)
Use the **Properties** window to view properties of selected elements. You can also use the **Properties** window to view file, project, and solution properties. The **Properties** window is available by clicking **Properties Window** on the **View** menu.  
  
The **Properties** window displays different types of editing fields, depending on the needs of a particular property. Properties shown in gray are read-only.  
  
## Options  
**Object name**  
Lists the currently selected object or objects. Only objects from the active editor or designer are visible.  
  
**Categorized**  
Lists all properties and property values for the selected object, by category. You can collapse a category to reduce the number of visible properties. When you expand or collapse a category, you see a plus (**+**) or minus (**-**) to the left of the category name. Categories are listed alphabetically.  
  
**Alphabetic**  
Alphabetically sorts all design-time properties and events for selected objects.  
  
**Properties**  
Displays the properties for an object.  
  
**Description pane**  
The description pane appears at the bottom of the **Properties** window and shows the property type and a short description of the property. You can turn the description of the property off and on using the **Description** command on the shortcut menu.
