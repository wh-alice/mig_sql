# Lift Chart Tab (Mining Accuracy Chart View)
  Use the **Lift Chart** pane to view a chart that compares all the selected mining models in the selected mining structure.  
  
 If the model predicts a discrete attribute, the pane can display either a lift chart or a profit chart. For information about lift charts, see [Lift Chart &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../analysis-services/data-mining/lift-chart-analysis-services-data-mining.md).  
  
 To create a profit chart, you must provide additional information about the cost of implementing the recommendations of the mining model, as well as the expected return. For more information, see [Profit Chart &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../analysis-services/data-mining/profit-chart-analysis-services-data-mining.md).  
  
 If the model predicts a continuous attribute, the pane will display a scatter plot graph.  
  
 For general information about methods of measuring the accuracy of a mining model, see [Lift Chart &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../analysis-services/data-mining/lift-chart-analysis-services-data-mining.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Chart Type**  
 Sets the type of chart to display in the viewer. You can select either **Lift Chart** or **Profit Chart**.  
  
 **Settings**  
 Opens the **Profit Chart Settings** dialog box, which you can use to configure a profit chart.  
  
 The profit chart is not available if a continuous predictable column was selected in the **Column Mapping** tab.  
  
 **Copy**  
 Copies the chart to the Clipboard.
