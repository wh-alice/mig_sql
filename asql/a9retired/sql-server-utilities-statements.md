# SQL Server Utilities Statements
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides commands that are not [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, but are recognized by the **sqlcmd** and **osql** utilities and [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Code Editor. These commands can be used to facilitate the readability and execution of batches and scripts.
