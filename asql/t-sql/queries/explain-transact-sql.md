# EXPLAIN (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-xxxx-asdw-pdw_md](../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-xxxx-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

  Returns the query plan for a [!INCLUDE[ssDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/ssdw-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[DWsql](../../a9retired/includes/dwsql-md.md)] statement without running the statement. Use **EXPLAIN** to preview which operations will require data movement and to view the estimated costs of the query operations.  
  
 For more information about query plans, see "Understanding Query Plans" in the [!INCLUDE[pdw-product-documentation_md](../../relational-databases/reference/system-dynamic-management-views/includes/pdw-product-documentation-md.md)].  
  
## Syntax  
  

```  
-- Syntax for Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
EXPLAIN SQL_statement  
[;]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *SQL_statement*  
 The [!INCLUDE[DWsql](../../a9retired/includes/dwsql-md.md)] statement on which **EXPLAIN** will run. *SQL_statement* can be any of these commands: **SELECT**, **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, **DELETE**, **CREATE TABLE AS SELECT**, **CREATE REMOTE TABLE**.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires the **SHOWPLAN** permission, and permission to execute *SQL_statement*. See [Permissions: GRANT, DENY, REVOKE &#40;Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Parallel Data Warehouse&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/permissions-grant-deny-revoke-azure-sql-data-warehouse-parallel-data-warehouse.md).  
  
## Return Value  
 The return value from the **EXPLAIN** command is an XML document with the structure shown below. This XML document lists all operations in the query plan for the given query, each enclosed by the `<dsql_operation>` tag. The return value is of type **nvarchar(max)**.  
  
 The returned query plan depicts sequential SQL statements; when the query runs it may involve parallelized operations, so some of the sequential statements shown may run at the same time.  
  
```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<dsql_query>  
  <sql>. . .</sql>  
  <params />  
  <dsql_operations>  
    <dsql_operation>  
     . . .      
    </dsql_operation>  
    [ . . . n ]  
  <dsql_operations>  
</dsql_query>  
```  
  
 The XML tags contain this information:  
  
|XML Tag|Summary, Attributes, and Content|  
|-------------|--------------------------------------|  
|<dsql_query>|Top level/document element.|  
|\<sql>|Echoes *SQL_statement*.|  
|\<params>|This tag is not used at this time.|  
|<dsql_operations>|Summarizes and contains the query steps, and includes cost information for the query. Also contains all of the `<dsql_operation>` blocks. This tag contains count information for the entire query:<br /><br /> `<dsql_operations total_cost=total_cost total_number_operations=total_number_operations>`<br /><br /> *total_cost* is the total estimated time for the query to run, in ms.<br /><br /> *total_number_operations* is the total number of operations for the query. An operation that will be parallelized and run on multiple nodes is counted as a single operation.|  
|<dsql_operation>|Describes a single operation within the query plan. The <dsql_operation> tag contains the operation type as an attribute:<br /><br /> `<dsql_operation operation_type=operation_type>`<br /><br /> *operation_type* is one of the values found in [Querying Data (SQL Server PDW)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3f4f5643-012a-4c36-b5ec-691c4bbe668c).<br /><br /> The content in the `<dsql_operation>` block is dependent on the operation type.<br /><br /> See the table below.|

## Limitations and Restrictions  
 **EXPLAIN** can be applied to *optimizable* queries only, which are queries that can be improved or modified based on the results of an **EXPLAIN** command. The supported **EXPLAIN** commands are listed above. Attempting to use **EXPLAIN** with an unsupported query type will either return an error or echo the query.  
  
 **EXPLAIN** is not supported in a user transaction.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows an **EXPLAIN** command run on a **SELECT** statement, and the XML result.  
  
 **Submitting an EXPLAIN statement**  
  
 The submitted command for this example is:  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorksPDW2012;  
EXPLAIN   
    SELECT CAST (AVG(YearlyIncome) AS int) AS AverageIncome,   
        CAST(AVG(FIS.SalesAmount) AS int) AS AverageSales,   
        G.StateProvinceName, T.SalesTerritoryGroup  
    FROM dbo.DimGeography AS G  
    JOIN dbo.DimSalesTerritory AS T  
        ON G.SalesTerritoryKey = T.SalesTerritoryKey  
    JOIN dbo.DimCustomer AS C  
        ON G.GeographyKey = C.GeographyKey  
    JOIN dbo.FactInternetSales AS FIS  
        ON C.CustomerKey = FIS.CustomerKey  
    WHERE T.SalesTerritoryGroup IN ('North America', 'Pacific')  
        AND Gender = 'F'  
    GROUP BY G.StateProvinceName, T.SalesTerritoryGroup  
    ORDER BY AVG(YearlyIncome) DESC;  
GO  
```  
  
 After executing the statement using the **EXPLAIN** option, the message tab presents a single line titled **explain**, and starting with the XML text `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>` Click on the XML to open the entire text in an XML window. To better understand the following comments, you should turn on the display of line numbers in SSDT.  
  
#### To turn on line numbers  
  
1.  With the output appearing in the **explain** tab SSDT, on the **TOOLS** menu, select **Options**.  
  
2.  Expand the **Text Editor** section, expand **XML**, and then click **General**.  
  
3.  In the **Display** area, check **Line numbers**.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
 **Example EXPLAIN output**  
  
 The XML result of the **EXPLAIN** command with row numbers turned on is:  
  
```  
1  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
2  <dsql_query>  
3    <sql>SELECT CAST (AVG(YearlyIncome) AS int) AS AverageIncome,

 **Meaning of the EXPLAIN output**  
  
 The output above contains 144 numbered lines. Your output from this query may differ slightly. The following list describes significant sections.  
  
-   Lines 3 through 16 provide a description of the query that is being analyzed.  
  
-   Line 17, specifies that the total number of operations will be 9. You can find the start of each operation, by looking for the words **dsql_operation**.  
  
-   Line 18 starts operation 1. Lines 18 and 19 indicate that a **RND_ID** operation will create a random ID number that will be used for an object description. The object described in the output above is **TEMP_ID_16893**. Your number will be different.  
  
-   Line 20 starts operation 2. Lines 21 through 25: On all compute nodes, create a temporary table named **TEMP_ID_16893**.  
  
-   Line 26 starts operation 3. Lines 27 through 37: Move data to **TEMP_ID_16893** by using a broadcast move. The query sent to each compute node is provided. Line 37 specifies the destination table is **TEMP_ID_16893**.  
  
-   Line 38 starts operation 4. Lines 39 through 40: Create a random ID for a table. **TEMP_ID_16894** is the ID number in the example above. Your number will be different.  
  
-   Line 41 starts operation 5. Lines 42 through 46: On all nodes, create a temporary table named **TEMP_ID_16894**.  
  
-   Line 47 starts operation 6. Lines 48 through 91: Move data from various tables (including **TEMP_ID_16893**) to table **TEMP_ID_16894**, by using a shuffle move operation. The query sent to each compute node is provided. Line 90 specifies the destination table as **TEMP_ID_16894**. Line 91 specifies the columns.  
  
-   Line 92 starts operation 7. Lines 93 through 97: On all compute nodes, drop temporary table **TEMP_ID_16893**.  
  
-   Line 98 starts operation 8. Lines 99 through 135: Return results to the client. Uses the query provided to get the results.  
  
-   Line 136 starts operation 9. Lines 137 through 140: On all nodes, drop temporary table **TEMP_ID_16894**.

 The following example shows an **EXPLAIN** command run on a **SELECT** statement, and the XML result.  
  
 **Submitting an EXPLAIN statement**  
  
 The submitted command for this example is:  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
EXPLAIN   
    SELECT CAST (AVG(YearlyIncome) AS int) AS AverageIncome,   
        CAST(AVG(FIS.SalesAmount) AS int) AS AverageSales,   
        G.StateProvinceName, T.SalesTerritoryGroup  
    FROM dbo.DimGeography AS G  
    JOIN dbo.DimSalesTerritory AS T  
        ON G.SalesTerritoryKey = T.SalesTerritoryKey  
    JOIN dbo.DimCustomer AS C  
        ON G.GeographyKey = C.GeographyKey  
    JOIN dbo.FactInternetSales AS FIS  
        ON C.CustomerKey = FIS.CustomerKey  
    WHERE T.SalesTerritoryGroup IN ('North America', 'Pacific')  
        AND Gender = 'F'  
    GROUP BY G.StateProvinceName, T.SalesTerritoryGroup  
    ORDER BY AVG(YearlyIncome) DESC;  
GO  
```  
  
 After executing the statement using the **EXPLAIN** option, the message tab presents a single line titled **explain**, and starting with the XML text `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>` Click on the XML to open the entire text in an XML window. To better understand the following comments, you should turn on the display of line numbers in SSDT.  
  
#### To turn on line numbers  
  
1.  With the output appearing in the **explain** tab SSDT, on the **TOOLS** menu, select **Options**.  
  
2.  Expand the **Text Editor** section, expand **XML**, and then click **General**.  
  
3.  In the **Display** area, check **Line numbers**.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
 **Example EXPLAIN output**  
  
 The XML result of the **EXPLAIN** command with row numbers turned on is:
