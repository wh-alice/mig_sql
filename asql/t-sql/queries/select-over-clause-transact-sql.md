# SELECT - OVER Clause (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Determines the partitioning and ordering of a rowset before the associated window function is applied. That is, the OVER clause defines a window or user-specified set of rows within a query result set. A window function then computes a value for each row in the window. You can use the OVER clause with functions to compute aggregated values such as moving averages, cumulative aggregates, running totals, or a top N per group results.

```  
-- Syntax for Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
OVER ( [ PARTITION BY value_expression ] [ order_by_clause ] )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 PARTITION BY  
 Divides the query result set into partitions. The window function is applied to each partition separately and computation restarts for each partition.  
  
 *value_expression*  
 Specifies the column by which the rowset is partitioned. *value_expression* can only refer to columns made available by the FROM clause. *value_expression* cannot refer to expressions or aliases in the select list. *value_expression* can be a column expression, scalar subquery, scalar function, or user-defined variable.  
  
 \<ORDER BY clause>  
 Defines the logical order of the rows within each partition of the result set. That is, it specifies the logical order in which the window functioncalculation is performed.  
  
 *order_by_expression*  
 Specifies a column or expression on which to sort. *order_by_expression* can only refer to columns made available by the FROM clause. An integer cannot be specified to represent a column name or alias.  
  
 COLLATE *collation_name*  
 Specifies that the ORDER BY operation should be performed according to the collation specified in *collation_name*. *collation_name* can be either a Windows collation name or a SQL collation name. For more information, see [Collation and Unicode Support](../../relational-databases/collations/collation-and-unicode-support.md). COLLATE is applicable only for columns of type **char**, **varchar**, **nchar**, and **nvarchar**.  
  
 **ASC** | DESC  
 Specifies that the values in the specified column should be sorted in ascending or descending order. ASC is the default sort order. Null values are treated as the lowest possible values.  
  
 ROWS | RANGE  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Further limits the rows within the partition by specifying start and end points within the partition. This is done by specifying a range of rows with respect to the current row either by logical association or physical association. Physical association is achieved by using the ROWS clause.  
  
 The ROWS clause limits the rows within a partition by specifying a fixed number of rows preceding or following the current row. Alternatively, the RANGE clause logically limits the rows within a partition by specifying a range of values with respect to the value in the current row. Preceding and following rows are defined based on the ordering in the ORDER BY clause. The window frame “RANGE … CURRENT ROW …” includes all rows that have the same values in the ORDER BY expression as the current row. For example, ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW means that the window of rows that the function operates on is three rows in size, starting with 2 rows preceding until and including the current row.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  ROWS or RANGE requires that the ORDER BY clause be specified. If ORDER BY contains multiple order expressions, CURRENT ROW FOR RANGE considers all columns in the ORDER BY list when determining the current row.  
  
 UNBOUNDED PRECEDING  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Specifies that the window starts at the first row of the partition. UNBOUNDED PRECEDING can only be specified as window starting point.  
  
 \<unsigned value specification> PRECEDING  
 Specified with \<unsigned value specification>to indicate the number of rows or values to precede the current row. This specification is not allowed for RANGE.  
  
 CURRENT ROW  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Specifies that the window starts or ends at the current row when used with ROWS or the current value when used with RANGE. CURRENT ROW can be specified as both a starting and ending point.  
  
 BETWEEN \<window frame bound > AND \<window frame bound >  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Used with either ROWS or RANGE to specify the lower (starting) and upper (ending) boundary points of the window. \<window frame bound> defines the boundary starting point and \<window frame bound> defines the boundary end point. The upper bound cannot be smaller than the lower bound.  
  
 UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Specifies that the window ends at the last row of the partition. UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING can only be specified as a window end point. For example RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING defines a window that starts with the current row and ends with the last row of the partition.  
  
 \<unsigned value specification> FOLLOWING  
 Specified with \<unsigned value specification> to indicate the number of rows or values to follow the current row. When \<unsigned value specification> FOLLOWING is specified as the window starting point, the ending point must be \<unsigned value specification>FOLLOWING. For example, ROWS BETWEEN 2 FOLLOWING AND 10 FOLLOWING defines a window that starts with the second row that follows the current row and ends with the tenth row that follows the current row. This specification is not allowed for RANGE.  
  
 unsigned integer literal  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Is a positive integer literal (including 0) that specifies the number of rows or values to precede or follow the current row or value. This specification is valid only for ROWS.  
  
## General Remarks  
 More than one window function can be used in a single query with a single FROM clause. The OVER clause for each function can differ in partitioning and ordering.  
  
 If PARTITION BY is not specified, the function treats all rows of the query result set as a single group. 
 
### Important!

If ROWS/RANGE is specified and \<window frame preceding> is used for \<window frame extent> (short syntax) then this specification is used for the window frame boundary starting point and CURRENT ROW is used for the boundary ending point. For example “ROWS 5 PRECEDING” is equal to “ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW”.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> If ORDER BY is not specified entire partition is used for a window frame. This applies only to functions that do not require ORDER BY clause. If ROWS/RANGE is not specified but ORDER BY is specified, RANGE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW is used as default for window frame. This applies only to functions that have can accept optional ROWS/RANGE specification. For example, ranking functions cannot accept ROWS/RANGE, therefore this window frame is not applied even though ORDER BY is present and ROWS/RANGE is not.  
    
## Limitations and Restrictions  
 The OVER clause cannot be used with the CHECKSUM aggregate function.  
  
 RANGE cannot be used with \<unsigned value specification> PRECEDING or \<unsigned value specification> FOLLOWING.  
  
 Depending on the  ranking, aggregate, or analytic function used with the OVER clause, \<ORDER BY clause> and/or the \<ROWS and RANGE clause> may not be supported.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using the OVER clause with the ROW_NUMBER function  
 The following example shows using the OVER clause with ROW_NUMBER function to display a row number for each row within a partition. The ORDER BY clause specified in the OVER clause orders the rows in each partition by the column `SalesYTD`. The ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement determines the order in which the entire query result set is returned.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY PostalCode ORDER BY SalesYTD DESC) AS "Row Number",   
    p.LastName, s.SalesYTD, a.PostalCode  
FROM Sales.SalesPerson AS s   
    INNER JOIN Person.Person AS p   
        ON s.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID  
    INNER JOIN Person.Address AS a   
        ON a.AddressID = p.BusinessEntityID  
WHERE TerritoryID IS NOT NULL   
    AND SalesYTD <> 0  
ORDER BY PostalCode;  
GO  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]

 `5               Vargas                  1453719.4653          98027`

### B. Using the OVER clause with aggregate functions  
 The following example uses the `OVER` clause with aggregate functions over all rows returned by the query. In this example, using the `OVER` clause is more efficient than using subqueries to derive the aggregate values.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT SalesOrderID, ProductID, OrderQty  
    ,SUM(OrderQty) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderID) AS Total  
    ,AVG(OrderQty) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderID) AS "Avg"  
    ,COUNT(OrderQty) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderID) AS "Count"  
    ,MIN(OrderQty) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderID) AS "Min"  
    ,MAX(OrderQty) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderID) AS "Max"  
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail   
WHERE SalesOrderID IN(43659,43664);  
GO  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
```  
SalesOrderID ProductID   OrderQty Total       Avg         Count       Min    Max

43659        714         3        26          2           12          1      6  
43659        716         1        26          2           12          1      6

43664        775         4        14          1           8           1      4  
43664        714         1        14          1           8           1      4  
43664        716         1        14          1           8           1      4  
43664        777         2        14          1           8           1      4  
43664        771         3        14          1           8           1      4  
43664        773         1        14          1           8           1      4

```  
  
 The following example shows using the `OVER` clause with an aggregate function in a calculated value.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT SalesOrderID, ProductID, OrderQty  
    ,SUM(OrderQty) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderID) AS Total  
    ,CAST(1. * OrderQty / SUM(OrderQty) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderID)   
        *100 AS DECIMAL(5,2))AS "Percent by ProductID"  
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail   
WHERE SalesOrderID IN(43659,43664);  
GO  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)] Notice that the aggregates are calculated by `SalesOrderID` and the `Percent by ProductID` is calculated for each line of each `SalesOrderID`.  
  
```

### C. Producing a moving average and cumulative total  
 The following example uses the AVG and SUM functions with the OVER clause to provide a moving average and cumulative total of yearly sales for each territory in the `Sales.SalesPerson` table. The data is partitioned by `TerritoryID` and logically ordered by `SalesYTD`. This means that the AVG function is computed for each territory based on the sales year. Notice that for `TerritoryID` 1, there are two rows for sales year 2005 representing the two sales people with sales that year. The average sales for these two rows is computed and then the third row representing sales for the year 2006 is included in the computation.

 In this example, the OVER clause does not include PARTITION BY. This means that the function will be applied to all rows returned by the query. The ORDER BY clause specified in the OVER clause determines the logical order to which the AVG function is applied. The query returns a moving average of sales by year for all sales territories specified in the WHERE clause. The ORDER BY clause specified in the SELECT statement determines the order in which the rows of the query are displayed.

### E. Using the OVER clause with the ROW_NUMBER function  
 The following example returns the ROW_NUMBER for sales representatives based on their assigned sales quota.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(SalesAmountQuota) DESC) AS RowNumber,  
    FirstName, LastName,   
CONVERT(varchar(13), SUM(SalesAmountQuota),1) AS SalesQuota   
FROM dbo.DimEmployee AS e  
INNER JOIN dbo.FactSalesQuota AS sq  
    ON e.EmployeeKey = sq.EmployeeKey  
WHERE e.SalesPersonFlag = 1  
GROUP BY LastName, FirstName;  
```  
  
 Here is a partial result set.  
  
 `RowNumber  FirstName  LastName            SalesQuota`  
  
 `---------  ---------  ------------------  -------------`  
  
 `1          Jillian    Carson              12,198,000.00`  
  
 `2          Linda      Mitchell            11,786,000.00`  
  
 `3          Michael    Blythe              11,162,000.00`  
  
 `4          Jae        Pak                 10,514,000.00`  
  
### F. Using the OVER clause with aggregate functions  
 The following examples show using the OVER clause with aggregate functions. In this example, using the OVER clause is more efficient than using subqueries.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT SalesOrderNumber AS OrderNumber, ProductKey,   
       OrderQuantity AS Qty,   
       SUM(OrderQuantity) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber) AS Total,  
       AVG(OrderQuantity) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber) AS Avg,  
       COUNT(OrderQuantity) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber) AS Count,  
       MIN(OrderQuantity) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber) AS Min,  
       MAX(OrderQuantity) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber) AS Max  
FROM dbo.FactResellerSales   
WHERE SalesOrderNumber IN(N'SO43659',N'SO43664') AND  
      ProductKey LIKE '2%'  
ORDER BY SalesOrderNumber,ProductKey;  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 `OrderNumber  Product  Qty  Total  Avg  Count  Min  Max`  
  
 `-----------  -------  ---  -----  ---  -----  ---  ---`  
  
 `SO43659      218      6    16     3    5      1    6`  
  
 `SO43659      220      4    16     3    5      1    6`  
  
 `SO43659      223      2    16     3    5      1    6`  
  
 `SO43659      229      3    16     3    5      1    6`  
  
 `SO43659      235      1    16     3    5      1    6`  
  
 `SO43664      229      1     2     1    2      1    1`  
  
 `SO43664      235      1     2     1    2      1    1`  
  
 The following example shows using the OVER clause with an aggregate function in a calculated value. Notice that the aggregates are calculated by `SalesOrderNumber` and the percentage of the total sales order is calculated for each line of each `SalesOrderNumber`.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT SalesOrderNumber AS OrderNumber, ProductKey AS Product,   
       OrderQuantity AS Qty,   
       SUM(OrderQuantity) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber) AS Total,  
       CAST(1. * OrderQuantity / SUM(OrderQuantity)   
        OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber)   
            *100 AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS PctByProduct  
FROM dbo.FactResellerSales   
WHERE SalesOrderNumber IN(N'SO43659',N'SO43664') AND  
      ProductKey LIKE '2%'  
ORDER BY SalesOrderNumber,ProductKey;  
```  
  
 The first start of this result set is:  
  
 `OrderNumber  Product  Qty  Total  PctByProduct`  
  
 `-----------  -------  ---  -----  ------------`  
  
 `SO43659      218      6    16     37.50`  
  
 `SO43659      220      4    16     25.00`  
  
 `SO43659      223      2    16     12.50`  
  
 `SO43659      229      2    16     18.75`
