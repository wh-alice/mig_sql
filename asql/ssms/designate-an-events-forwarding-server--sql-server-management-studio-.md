# Designate an Events Forwarding Server (SQL Server Management Studio)
This topic describes how to designate a server to which Microsoft SQL Server forwards events in SQL Server 2016 by using SQL Server Management Studio . Note that event forwarding applies to events forwarded between servers, not to events forwarded between instances of SQL Server hosted on a single computer. Also note that in order to receive forwarded events, the alerts management server must be a default instance of SQL Server.
