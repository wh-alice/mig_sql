# Connecting to an Instance of SQL Server
  The first programming step in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO) application is to create an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server> object and to establish its connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 You can create an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server> object and establish a connection to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in three ways. The first is using a <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object variable to provide the connection information. The second is to provide the connection information by explicitly setting the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server> object properties. The third is to pass the name of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance in the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server> object constructor. 
 
> [!NOTE] 
> **Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo.dll** is located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\130\SDK\Assemblies`.
  
 **Using a ServerConnection object**  
  
 The advantage of using the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object variable is that the connection information can be reused. Declare a <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server> object variable. Then, declare a <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object and set properties with connection information such as the name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and the authentication mode. Then, pass the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object variable as a parameter to the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server> object constructor. It is not recommended to share connections between different server objects at the same time. Use the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection.Copy%2A> method to get a copy of the existing connection settings.  
  
 **Setting Server object properties explicitly**  
  
 Alternatively, you can declare the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server> object variable and call the default constructor. As is, the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server> object tries to connect to the default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with all the default connection settings.  
  
 **Providing the SQL Server instance name in the Server object constructor**  
  
 Declare the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server> object variable and pass the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance name as a string parameter in the constructor. The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server> object establishes a connection with the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with the default connection settings.  
  
## Connection Pooling  
 It is typically not required to call the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ConnectionManager.Connect%2A> method of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object. SMO will automatically establish a connection when required, and release the connection to the connection pool after it has finished performing operations. When the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ConnectionManager.Connect%2A> method is called, the connection is not released to the pool. An explicit call to the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ConnectionManager.Disconnect%2A> method is required to release the connection to the pool. Additionally, you can request a non-pooled connection by setting the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ConnectionSettings.NonPooledConnection%2A> property of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object.  
  
## Multithreaded Applications  
 For multithreaded applications, a separate <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object should be used in each thread.  
  
## Connecting to an Instance of SQL Server for RMO  
 Replication Management Objects (RMO) uses a slightly different method from SMO to connect to a replication server.  
  
 RMO programming objects require that a connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is made by using the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object implemented by the **Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common** namespace. This connection to the server is made independently of an RMO programming object. It is then it is passed to the RMO object either during instance creation or by assignment to the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.ConnectionContext%2A> property of the object. In this manner, an RMO programming object and the connection object instances can be created and managed separately, and a single connection object can be reused with multiple RMO programming objects. The following rules apply for connections to a replication server:  
  
-   All properties for the connection are defined for a specified <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object.  
  
-   Each connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] must have its own <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object.  
  
-   All authentication information to make the connection and successfully log on to the server is supplied in the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object.  
  
-   By default, connections are made by using Microsoft Windows Authentication. To use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ConnectionSettings.LoginSecure%2A> must be set to False and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ConnectionSettings.Login%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ConnectionSettings.Password%2A> must be set to a valid [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] logon and password. Security credentials must always be stored and handled securely, and supplied at run time whenever possible.  
  
-   The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ConnectionManager.Connect%2A> method must be called before passing the connection to any RMO programming object.  
  
## Examples  
To use any code example that is provided, you will have to choose the programming environment, the programming template, and the programming language in which to create your application. For more information, see [Create a Visual Basic SMO Project in Visual Studio .NET](../../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/how-to-create-a-visual-basic-smo-project-in-visual-studio-.net.md) or [Create a Visual C&#35; SMO Project in Visual Studio .NET](../../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/how-to-create-a-visual-csharp-smo-project-in-visual-studio-.net.md).  
  
## Connecting to the Local Instance of SQL Server by Using Windows Authentication in Visual Basic  
 Connecting to the local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not require much code. Instead, it relies on default settings for authentication method and server. The first operation that requires data to be retrieved will cause a connection to be created.  
 
This example is Visual Basic .NET code that connects to the local instance of SQL Server by using Windows Authentication. 

```VBNET
'Connect to the local, default instance of SQL Server.
Dim srv As Server
srv = New Server
'The connection is established when a property is requested.
Console.WriteLine(srv.Information.Version)
'The connection is automatically disconnected when the Server variable goes out of scope.
```
  
## Connecting to the Local Instance of SQL Server by Using Windows Authentication in Visual C#  
 Connecting to the local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not require much code. Instead, it relies on default settings for authentication method and server. The first operation that requires data to be retrieved will cause a connection to be created.  
  
 This example is Visual C# .NET code that connects to the local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using Windows Authentication.  
  
```c#  
{   
//Connect to the local, default instance of SQL Server.   
Server srv;   
srv = new Server();   
//The connection is established when a property is requested.   
Console.WriteLine(srv.Information.Version);   
}   
//The connection is automatically disconnected when the Server variable goes out of scope.  
```  
  
## Connecting to a Remote Instance of SQL Server by Using Windows Authentication in Visual Basic  
 When you connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using Windows Authentication, you do not have to specify the authentication type. Windows Authentication is the default.  
  
 This example is [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../a9retired/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] .NET code that connects to the remote instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using Windows Authentication. The string variable *strServer* contains the name of the remote instance.  
  
```VBNET   
'Connect to a remote instance of SQL Server.
Dim srv As Server
'The strServer string variable contains the name of a remote instance of SQL Server.
srv = New Server(strServer)
'The actual connection is made when a property is retrieved. 
Console.WriteLine(srv.Information.Version)
'The connection is automatically disconnected when the Server variable goes out of scope.
```

Console.WriteLine(srv.Information.Version);   
}   
//The connection is automatically disconnected when the Server variable goes out of scope.

This example demonstrates the alternative method of declaring a <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection> object variable, which enables the connection information to be reused.  
  
 The example is [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../a9retired/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] .NET code that demonstrates how to connect to the remote and *vPassword* contain the logon and password.

      Dim srvConn2 As New ServerConnection(remoteSvrName)  
      srvConn2.LoginSecure = False  
      srvConn2.Login = sqlServerLogin  
      srvConn2.Password = password  
      Dim srv3 As New Server(srvConn2)  
      Console.WriteLine(srv3.Information.Version)   ' connection is established  
   End Sub  
End Class  
```
