# sp_syspolicy_rename_policy (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Renames an existing policy in Policy-Based Management.  
  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_syspolicy_rename_policy { [ @name = ] 'name' | [ @policy_id = ] policy_id }  
    , [ @new_name = ] 'new_name'  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@name=** ] **'***name***'**  
 Is the name of the policy that you want to rename. *name* is **sysname**, and must be specified if *policy_id* is NULL.  
  
 [ **@policy_id=** ] *policy_id*  
 Is the identifier for the policy that you want to rename. *policy_id* is **int**, and must be specified if *name* is NULL.  
  
 [ **@new_name=** ] **'***new_name***'**  
 Is the new name for the policy. *new_name* is **sysname**, and is required. Cannot be NULL or an empty string.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 You must run sp_syspolicy_rename_policy in the context of the msdb system database.  
  
 You must specify a value for either *name* or *policy_id*. Both cannot be NULL. To obtain these values, query the msdb.dbo.syspolicy_policies system view.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires membership in the PolicyAdministratorRole fixed database role.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Possible elevation of credentials: Users in the PolicyAdministratorRole role can create server triggers and schedule policy executions that can affect the operation of the instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)]. For example, users in the PolicyAdministratorRole role can create a policy that can prevent most objects from being created in the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)]. Because of this possible elevation of credentials, the PolicyAdministratorRole role should be granted only to users who are trusted with controlling the configuration of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
## Examples  
 The following example renames a policy that is named 'Test Policy 1' to 'Test Policy 2'.  
  
```  
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_syspolicy_rename_policy @name = N'Test Policy 1'  
, @new_name = N'Test Policy 2';  
  
GO  
```
