|**login_time**|**datetime**|Date and time at which login for the connection succeeded. NULLABLE.|  
|**authentication_method**|**nvarchar(128)**|Name of the Windows Authentication method, such as NTLM or KERBEROS. The value comes from Windows. NULLABLE.|  
|**principal_name**|**nvarchar(128)**|Name of the login that was validated for connection permissions. For Windows Authentication, this value is the remote user name. For certificate authentication, this value is the certificate owner. NULLABLE.|
