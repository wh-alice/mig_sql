# catalog.deny_permission (SSISDB Database)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../integration-services/system/stored-procedures/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Denies a permission on a securable object in the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] catalog.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
deny_permission [ @object_type = ] object_type  
    , [ @object_id = ] object_id  
    , [ @principal_id = ] principal_id  
    , [ @permission_type = ] permission_type  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ @object_type = ] *object_type*  
 The type of securable object. Securable objects types include folder (`1`), project (`2`), environment (`3`), and operation (`4`).The *object_type* is **smallint***.*  
  
 [ @object_id = ] *object_id*  
 The unique identifier (ID) or primary key of the securable object. The *object_id* is **bigint**.  
  
 [ @principal_id = ] *principal_id*  
 The ID of the principal who is to be denied. The *principal_id* is **int**.  
  
 [ @permission_type = ] *permission_type*  
 The type of permission that is to be denied. The *permission_type* is **smallint**.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 0 (success)  
  
 1 (object_class is not valid)  
  
 2 (object_id does not exist)  
  
 3 (principal does not exist)  
  
 4 (permission is not valid)  
  
 5 (other error)  
  
## Result Sets  
 None  
  
## Permissions  
 This stored procedure requires one of the following permissions:  
  
-   MANAGE_PERMISSIONS permission on the object  
  
-   Membership to the **ssis_admin** database role  
  
-   Membership to the **sysadmin** server role  
  
## Remarks  
 This stored procedure allows you to deny the permission types described in the following table:  
  
|permission_type Value|Permission Name|Permission Description|Applicable Object Types|  
|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|  
|`1`|READ|Allows the principal to read information that is considered part of the object, such as properties. It does not allow the principal to enumerate or read the contents of other objects contained within the object.|Folder, Project, Environment, Operation|  
|`2`|MODIFY|Allows the principal to modify information that is considered part of the object, such as properties. It does not allow the principal to modify other objects contained within the object.|Folder, Project, Environment, Operation|  
|`3`|EXECUTE|Allows the principal to execute all packages in the project.|Project|  
|`4`|MANAGE_PERMISSIONS|Allows the principal to assign permissions to the objects.|Folder, Project, Environment, Operation|  
|`100`|CREATE_OBJECTS|Allows the principal to create objects in the folder.|Folder|  
|`101`|READ_OBJECTS|Allows the principal to read all objects in the folder.|Folder|  
|`102`|MODIFY_OBJECTS|Allows the principal to modify all objects in the folder.|Folder|  
|`103`|EXECUTE_OBJECTS|Allows the principal to execute all packages from all projects in the folder.|Folder|  
|`104`|MANAGE_OBJECT_PERMISSIONS|Allows the principal to manage permissions on all objects in the folder.|Folder|  
  
## Errors and Warnings  
 The following list describes some conditions that may raise an error or warning:  
  
-   If permission_type is specified, the procedure denies the specified permission that is explicitly assigned to the specified principal for the specified object. Even if there are no such instances, the procedure still returns a success code value (`0`).  
  
-   If permission_type is omitted, the procedure denies all permissions for the specified principal to the specified object.
