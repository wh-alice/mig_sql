# PowerShell cmdlets for Reporting Services SharePoint Mode
  When you install [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint mode, PowerShell cmdlets are installed to support report Servers in SharePoint mode. The cmdlets cover three categories of functionality.  
  
-   Installation of the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint shared service and proxy.  
  
-   Provisioning and management of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service applications and associated proxies.  
  
-   Management of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] features, for example extensions and encryption keys.

##  <a name="bkmk_cmdlet_sum"></a> Cmdlet Summary  
 To run the cmdlets you need to open the SharePoint Management Shell. You can also use the graphical user interface editor that is included with Microsoft Windows, **Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE)**. For more information, see [Starting Windows PowerShell on Windows Server](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh847814.aspx) (http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh847814.aspx). In the following cmdlet summaries, the references to service application ‘databases’, refer to all of the databases created and used by a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service application. This includes the configuration, alerting, and temp databases.  
  
 If you see an error message similar to the following when you type the PowerShell examples:  
  
-   Install-SPRSService : The term 'Install-SPRSService' is not recognized as the  
    name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.  
  
 One of the following issues is occurring:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint mode is not installed and therefore the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] cmdlets are not installed.  
  
-   You ran the PowerShell command in Windows PowerShell or Windows PowerShell ISE instead of the SharePoint Management Shell. Use the SharePoint Management shell or add the SharePoint Snap-in to the Windows PowerShell window with the following command:  
  
    ```  
    Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell  
    ```  
  
 For more information see [Use Windows PowerShell to administer SharePoint 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee806878.aspx) (http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee806878.aspx).  
  
#### To Open the SharePoint Management Shell and run cmdlets  
  
1.  Click the **Start** button  
  
2.  Click the **Microsoft SharePoint Products** group.  
  
3.  Click the **SharePoint Management Shell**.  
  
 To view command line help for a cmdlet use the PowerShell ‘Get-Help’ command at the PowerShell command prompt. For example:  
  
 `Get-Help Get-SPRSServiceApplicationServers`  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_sharedservice_cmdlets"></a> Shared Service and Proxy Cmdlets  
 The following table contains the PowerShell cmdlets for the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint shared service.  
  
|Cmdlet|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|Install-SPRSService|Installs and registers, or uninstalls, the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] shared service. This can be done only on the machine that has an installation of SQL Server [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] in SharePoint mode. For installation, two operations occur:<br /><br /> -The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service is installed in the farm.<br /><br /> -The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service instance is installed to the current machine.<br /><br /> For Uninstallation, two operations occur:<br /><br /> -The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service is uninstalled from the current machine.<br /><br /> -The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service is uninstalled from the farm.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> NOTE: If there are any other machines in the farm that have the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service installed, or if there are still [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service applications running in the farm, a warning message is displayed.|

##  <a name="bkmk_basic_samples"></a> Basic Samples Reporting Services PowerShell  
 Return a list of cmdlets that contain ‘SPRS’ in the name. This will be the full list of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] cmdlets.  
  
```  
Get-command –noun *SPRS*  
```  
  
 Or with a little more detail, piped to a text file named commandlist.txt  
  
```  
Get-command -noun *SPRS* | Select name, definition | Format-List | Out-File c:\commandlist.txt  
```  
  
 Install the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint service and service proxy.  
  
```  
Install-SPRSService  
```  
  
```  
Install-SPRSServiceProxy  
```  
  
 Start the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service  
  
```  
get-spserviceinstance -all |where {$_.TypeName -like "SQL Server Reporting*"} | Start-SPServiceInstance  
```  
  
 Type the following command from the SharePoint Management Shell to return a filtered list of rows from the a log file. The command will filter for lines that contain “ssrscustomactionerror”. This example is looking at the log file created when the rssharepoint.msi was installed.  
  
```  
Get-content -path C:\Users\testuser\AppData\Local\Temp\rs_sp_0.log | select-string "ssrscustomactionerror"  
```  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_detailedsamples"></a> Detailed Reporting Services PowerShell Samples  
 In addition to the following samples, see the section “Windows PowerShell Script” in the topic [Windows PowerShell script for Steps 1–4](../../../reporting-services/install/windows/install-the-first-report-server-in-sharepoint-mode.md#bkmk_full_script).  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_example_create_service_application"></a> Create a reporting services service application and proxy  
 This sample script completes the following tasks:  
  
1.  Create a Reporting Services service application and proxy. The script assumes the application pool “My App Pool” already exists.  
  
2.  Add the proxy to the default proxy group  
  
3.  Grant the service app access to the port 80 web app’s content database. The script assumes site “http://sitename” already exists.  
  
```  
# Create service application and service application proxy  
$appPool = Get-SPServiceApplicationPool “My App Pool”  
$serviceApp = New-SPRSServiceApplication “My RS Service App” –ApplicationPool $appPool  
$serviceAppProxy = New-SPRSServiceApplicationProxy –Name “My RS Service App Proxy” –ServiceApplication $serviceApp  
  
# Add service application proxy to default proxy group.  Any web application that uses the default proxy group will now be able to use this service application.  
Get-SPServiceApplicationProxyGroup –default | Add-SPServiceApplicationProxyGroupMember –Member $serviceAppProxy  
  
# Grant application pool account access to the port 80 web application’s content database.  
$webApp = Get-SPWebApplication “http://sitename”  
$appPoolAccountName = $appPool.ProcessAccount.LookupName()  
$webApp.GrantAccessToProcessIdentity($appPoolAccountName)  
  
```  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_example_delivery_extension"></a> Review and update a reporting services delivery extension  
 The following PowerShell script example, updates the configuration for the report server e-mail delivery extension for the service application named `My RS Service App`. Update the values for the SMTP server (`<email server name>`) and the FROM email alias (`<your FROM email address>`).  
  
```  
$app=get-sprsserviceapplication -Name "My RS Service App"  
$emailCfg = Get-SPRSExtension -identity $app -ExtensionType "Delivery" -name "Report Server Email" | select -ExpandProperty ConfigurationXml   
$emailXml = [xml]$emailCfg   
$emailXml.SelectSingleNode("//SMTPServer").InnerText = “<email server name>”  
$emailXml.SelectSingleNode("//SendUsing").InnerText = "2"  
$emailXml.SelectSingleNode("//SMTPAuthenticate").InnerText = "2"  
$emailXml.SelectSingleNode("//From").InnerText = '<your FROM email address>'  
Set-SPRSExtension -identity $app -ExtensionType "Delivery" -name "Report Server Email" -ExtensionConfiguration $emailXml.OuterXml  
```  
  
 In the above example if you did not know the exact name of the service application, you could rewrite the first statement to get the service application based on a search of the partial name. For example:  
  
```  
$app=get-sprsserviceapplication | where {$_.name -like " ssrs_testapp *"}  
```  
  
 The following script will return the current configuration values for the report server e-mail delivery extension for the service application named “Reporting Services Application”. The first step sets the value of the variable $app to the object of the service application that has a name of " My RS Service App "  
  
 The second statement will Get the ‘Report Server Email’ delivery extension for the service application object in variable $app, and select the configurationXML  
  
```  
$app=get-sprsserviceapplication –Name "Reporting Services Application"  
Get-SPRSExtension -identity $app -ExtensionType "Delivery" -name "Report Server Email" | select -ExpandProperty ConfigurationXml  
```  
  
 You can also rewrite the above two statements as one:  
  
```  
get-sprsserviceapplication –Name "Reporting Services Application" | Get-SPRSExtension -ExtensionType "Delivery" -name "Report Server Email" | select -ExpandProperty ConfigurationXml  
```  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_example_db_properties"></a> Get and set Properties of the Reporting Service application database  
 The following example first returns a list of the databases and properties so you can determine the database guid (ID) that you then supply to the set command. For a full list of the properties, use `Get-SPRSDatabase | format-list`.  
  
```  
get-SPRSDatabase | select id, querytimeout,connectiontimeout, status, server, ServiceInstance   
```  
  
 The following is an example of the output. Determine the ID for the database you want to modify and use the ID in the SET cmdlet.  
  
-   `Id                : 56f8d1bc-cb04-44cf-bd41-a873643c5a14`  
  
     `QueryTimeout      : 120`  
  
     `ConnectionTimeout : 15`  
  
     `Status            : Online`  
  
     `Server            : SPServer Name=uetestb01`  
  
     `ServiceInstance   : SPDatabaseServiceInstance`  
  
```  
Set-SPRSDatabase –identity 56f8d1bc-cb04-44cf-bd41-a873643c5a14 -QueryTimeout 300  
```  
  
 To verify the value is set, run the GET cmdlet again.  
  
```  
Get-SPRSDatabase –identity 56f8d1bc-cb04-44cf-bd41-a873643c5a14 | select id, querytimeout,connectiontimeout, status, server, ServiceInstance  
```  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_example_list_data_extensions"></a> List Reporting Services data extensions  
 The following example loops through each [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service application and lists the current data extensions for each.  
  
```  
$apps = Get-SPRSServiceApplication  
foreach ($app in $apps)   
{  
Write-host -ForegroundColor "yellow" Service App Name $app.Name  
Get-SPRSExtension -identity $app -ExtensionType “Data” | select name,extensiontype | Format-Table -AutoSize  
}  
```  
  
 **Example output:**  
  
-   `Name           ExtensionType`  
  
     `----           -------------`  
  
     `SQL                     Data`  
  
     `SQLAZURE                Data`  
  
     `SQLPDW                  Data`  
  
     `OLEDB                   Data`  
  
     `OLEDB-MD                Data`  
  
     `ORACLE                  Data`  
  
     `ODBC                    Data`  
  
     `XML                     Data`  
  
     `SHAREPOINTLIST          Data`
