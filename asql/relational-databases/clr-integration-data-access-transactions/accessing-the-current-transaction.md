# Accessing the Current Transaction
  If a transaction is active at the point at which common language runtime (CLR) code running on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is entered, the transaction is exposed through the **System.Transactions.Transaction** class. The **Transaction.Current** property is used to access the current transaction. In most cases it is not necessary to access the transaction explicitly. For database connections, ADO.NET checks **Transaction.Current** automatically when the **Connection.Open** method is called, and transparently enlists the connection in that transaction (unless the **Enlist** keyword is set to false in the connection string).  
  
 You might want to use the **Transaction** object directly in the following scenarios:  
  
-   If you want to enlist a resource that does not do automatic enlistment, or that for some reason was not enlisted during initialization.  
  
-   If you want to explicitly enlist a resource in the transaction.  
  
-   If you want to terminate the external transaction from within your stored procedure or function. In this case, you use <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope>. For example, the following code will rollback the current transaction:  
  
    ```  
    using(TransactionScope transactionScope = new TransactionScope(TransactionScopeOptions.Required)) { }  
    ```  
  
 The rest of this topic describes other ways to cancel an external transaction.  
  
## Canceling an External Transaction  
 You can cancel external transactions from a managed procedure or function in the following ways:  
  
-   The managed procedure or function can return a value by using an output parameter. The calling [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] procedure can check the returned value and, if appropriate, execute **ROLLBACK TRANSACTION**.  
  
-   The managed procedure or function can throw a custom exception. The calling [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] procedure can catch the exception thrown by the managed procedure or function in a try/catch block and execute **ROLLBACK TRANSACTION**.  
  
-   The managed procedure or function can cancel the current transaction by calling the **Transaction.Rollback** method if a certain condition is met.  
  
 When it is called within a managed procedure or function, the **Transaction.Rollback** method throws an exception with an ambiguous error message and can be wrapped in a try/catch block. The error message thresembles similar to the following:  
  
```  
Msg 3994, Level 16, State 1, Procedure uspRollbackFromProc, Line 0  
Transaction is not allowed to roll back inside a user defined routine, trigger or aggregate because the transaction is not started in that CLR level. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting.  
```  
  
 This exception is expected and the try/catch block is necessary for code execution to continue. Without the try/catch block, the exception will be immediately thrown to the calling [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] procedure and managed code execution will finish. When the managed code finishes execution, another exception is raised:  
  
```  
Msg 3991, Level 16, State 1, Procedure uspRollbackFromProc, Line 1   
The context transaction which was active before entering user defined routine, trigger or aggregate " uspRollbackFromProc " has been ended inside of it, which is not allowed. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting. The statement has been terminated.  
```  
  
 This exception is also expected, and for execution to continue, you must have a try/catch block around the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement that performs the action that fires the trigger. Despite the two exceptions thrown, the transaction is rolled back and the changes are not committed.  
  
### Example  
 The following is an example of a transaction being rolled back from a managed procedure by using the **Transaction.Rollback** method. Notice the try/catch block around the **Transaction.Rollback** method in the managed code. The [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] script creates an assembly and managed stored procedure. Be aware that the **EXEC uspRollbackFromProc** statement is wrapped in a try/catch block, so that the exception thrown when the managed procedure completes execution is caught.  
  
```c#  
using System;  
using System.Data;  
using System.Data.SqlClient;  
using System.Data.SqlTypes;

[Microsoft.SqlServer.Server.SqlProcedure]

{  
   using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(@"context connection=true"))  
   {  
      // Open the connection.  
      connection.Open();  
  
      bool successCondition = true;  
  
      // Success condition is met.  
      if (successCondition)  
      {  
         SqlContext.Pipe.Send("Success condition met in procedure.");   
         // Perform other actions here.  
      }  
  
      //  Success condition is not met, the transaction will be rolled back.  
      else  
      {  
         SqlContext.Pipe.Send("Success condition not met in managed procedure. Transaction rolling back...");  
         try  
         {  
               // Get the current transaction and roll it back.  
               Transaction trans = Transaction.Current;  
               trans.Rollback();  
         }  
         catch (SqlException ex)  
         {  
            // Catch the expected exception.   
            // This allows the connection to close correctly.                      
         }    
      }  
  
      // Close the connection.  
      connection.Close();  
   }  
}  
};
