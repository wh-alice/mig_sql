# Developing with ADOMD.NET
  ADOMD.NET is a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework data provider that is designed to communicate with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. ADOMD.NET uses the XML for Analysis protocol to communicate with analytical data sources by using either TCP/IP or HTTP connections to transmit and receive SOAP requests and responses that are compliant with the XML for Analysis specification. Commands can be sent in Multidimensional Expressions (MDX), Data Mining Extensions (DMX), Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL), or even a limited syntax of SQL, and may not return a result. Analytical data, key performance indicators (KPIs), and mining models can be queried and manipulated by using the ADOMD.NET object model. By using ADOMD.NET, you can also view and work with metadata either by retrieving OLE DB-compliant schema rowsets or by using the ADOMD.NET object model.  
  
 The ADOMD.NET data provider is represented by the **Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient** namespace.
