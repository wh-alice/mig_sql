# Create User-defined Aggregates
  You can create a database object inside [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that is programmed in a CLR assembly. Database objects that can leverage the rich programming model provided by the CLR include triggers, stored procedures, functions, aggregate functions, and types.  
  
 Like the built-in aggregate functions provided in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)], user-defined aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value.  
  
 Creating a user-defined aggregate function in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] involves the following steps:  
  
-   Define the user-defined aggregate function as a class in a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework-supported language. For more information about how to program user-defined aggregates in the CLR, see [CLR User-Defined Aggregates](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-user-defined-functions/clr-user-defined-aggregates.md). Compile this class to build a CLR assembly using the appropriate language compiler.  
  
-   Register the assembly in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using the CREATE ASSEMBLY statement. For more information about assemblies in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Assemblies &#40;Database Engine&#41;](../../relational-databases/clr-integration/assemblies-database-engine.md).  
  
-   Create the user-defined aggregate that references the registered assembly using the CREATE AGGREGATE statement.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Deploying a SQL Server Project in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] registers an assembly in the database that was specified for the project. Deploying the project also creates a user-defined aggregate in the database for all class definitions annotated with the **SqlUserDefinedAggregate** attribute. For more information, see [Deploying CLR Database Objects](../../relational-databases/clr-integration/deploying-clr-database-objects.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The ability of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to execute CLR code is off by default. You can create, alter and drop database objects that reference managed code modules, but these references will not execute in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] unless the [clr enabled Option](../../database-engine/configure/windows/clr-enabled-server-configuration-option.md) is enabled using [sp_configure (Transact-SQL)](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md).  
  
 **To create, modify, or drop an assembly**  
  
-   [CREATE ASSEMBLY &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-assembly-transact-sql.md)  
  
-   [ALTER ASSEMBLY &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-assembly-transact-sql.md)  
  
-   [DROP ASSEMBLY &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/drop-assembly-transact-sql.md)  
  
 **To create a user-defined aggregate**  
  
-   [CREATE AGGREGATE &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-aggregate-transact-sql.md)
