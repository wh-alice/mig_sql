# sys.dm_hadr_availability_replica_states (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../integration-services/system/stored-procedures/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns a row for each local availability replica and a row for each remote availability replica in the same Always On availability group as a local replica. Each row contains information about the state of a given availability replica.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To obtain information about every availability replica in a given availability group, query **sys.dm_hadr_availability_replica_states** on the server instance that is hosting the primary replica. When queried on a server instance that is hosting a secondary replica of an availability group, this dynamic management view returns only local information for the availability group.

This value occurs only on the primary replica location.<br /><br /> 1 = Indicates a local availability replica.

|**role**|**tinyint**|Current [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] role of a local availability replica or a connected remote availability replica, one of:<br /><br /> 0 = Resolving<br /><br /> 1 = Primary<br /><br /> 2 = Secondary<br /><br /> For information about [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] roles, see [Overview of Always On Availability Groups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/overview-of-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server.md).|

|**recovery_health**|**tinyint**|Rollup of the **database_state** column of the [sys.dm_hadr_database_replica_states](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-dynamic-management-views/sys.dm-hadr-database-replica-states-transact-sql.md) dynamic management view. The following are the possible values and their descriptions.<br /><br /> 0 : In progress.  At least one joined database has a database state other than ONLINE (**database_state** is not 0).<br /><br /> 1 : Online. All the joined databases have a database state of ONLINE (**database_state** is 0).<br /><br /> NULL : **is_local** = 0|

The rollup will reflect the least healthy accumulated state the databases on the availability replica. Below are the possible values and their descriptions.<br /><br /> 0 : Not healthy.   At least one joined database is in the NOT SYNCHRONIZING state.<br /><br /> 1 : Partially healthy. Some replicas are not in the target synchronization state: synchronous-commit replicas should be synchronized, and asynchronous-commit replicas should be synchronizing.<br /><br /> 2 : Healthy. All replicas are in the target synchronization state: synchronous-commit replicas are synchronized, and asynchronous-commit replicas are synchronizing.|

|**connected_state**|**tinyint**|Whether a secondary replica is currently connected to the primary replica. The possible values are shown below with their descriptions.<br /><br /> 0 : Disconnected. The response of an availability replica to the DISCONNECTED state depends on its role: On the primary replica, if a secondary replica is disconnected, its secondary databases are marked as NOT SYNCHRONIZED on the primary replica, which waits for the secondary to reconnect; On a secondary replica, upon detecting that it is disconnected, the secondary replica attempts to reconnect to the primary replica.<br /><br /> 1 : Connected.<br /><br /> Each primary replica tracks the connection state for every secondary replica in the same availability group. Secondary replicas track the connection state of only the primary replica.|

##  <a name="RolesAndOperationalStates"></a> Roles and Operational States  
 The role, **role**, reflects the state of a given availability replica and the operational state, **operational_state**, describes whether the replica is ready to process client requests for all the database of the availability replica. The following is a summary of the operational states that are possible for each role: RESOLVING, PRIMARY, and SECONDARY.  
  
 **RESOLVING:** When an availability replica is in the RESOLVING role, the possible operational states are as shown in the following table.  
  
|Operational State|Description|  
|-----------------------|-----------------|  
|PENDING_FAILOVER|A failover command is being processed for the availability group.|  
|OFFLINE|All configuration data for the availability replica has been updated on WSFC cluster and, also, in local metadata, but the availability group currently lacks a primary replica.|  
|FAILED|A read failure has occurred during an attempt trying to retrieve information from the WSFC cluster.|  
|FAILED_NO_QUORUM|The local WSFC node does not have quorum. This is an inferred state.|  
  
 **PRIMARY:** When an availability replica is performing the PRIMARY role, it is currently the primary replica. The possible operational states are as shown in the following table.  
  
|Operational State|Description|  
|-----------------------|-----------------|  
|PENDING|This is a transient state, but a primary replica can be stuck in this state if workers are not available to process requests.|  
|ONLINE|The availability group resource is online, and all database worker threads have been picked up.|  
|FAILED|The availability replica is unable to read to and/or write from the WSFC cluster.|  
  
 **SECONDARY:** When an availability replica is performing the SECONDARY role, it is currently a secondary replica. The possible operational states are as shown in the table below.  
  
|Operational State|Description|  
|-----------------------|-----------------|  
|ONLINE|The local secondary replica  is connected to the primary replica.|  
|FAILED|The local secondary replica is unable to read to and/or write from the WSFC cluster.|  
|NULL|On a primary replica, this value is returned when the row relates to a secondary replica.|  
  
## Security  
  
### Permissions  
 Requires VIEW SERVER STATE permission on the server.
