# Solutions (SQL Server Management Studio)
A SQL Server Management Studio solution is a collection of one or more related projects. Projects are containers that developers use to organize related files, such as sets of commonly used administration scripts.  
  
## Solution Overview  
You can use Management Studio as a script development platform for Database Engine and Analysis Services. Use the Management Studio code editors to develop scripts and queries for relational and multidimensional databases, and collect related scripts and queries together in projects.  
  
Projects can contain:  
  
-   Queries and scripts that implement production processes.  
  
-   Connection information and files used by the queries and scripts.  
  
One or more related projects can be combined in a solution. Solutions and projects can be managed by using the Solution Explorer pane in Management Studio.  
  
Solutions and projects can be integrated into a Microsoft Visual SourceSafe (VSS) database or other third-party source control providers, for development change tracking and life-cycle management.
