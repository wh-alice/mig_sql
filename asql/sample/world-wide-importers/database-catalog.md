# Database catalog
The WideWorldImporters database contains all the transaction information and daily data for sales and purchases, as well as sensor data for vehicles and cold rooms.

## Schemas

WideWorldImporters uses schemas for different purposes, such as storing data, defining how users can access the data, and providing objects for data warehouse development and integration.

### Data schemas

These schemas contain the data. A number of tables are needed by all other schemas and are located in the Application schema.

|Schema|Description|
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
|Application|Application-wide users, contacts, and parameters. This also contains reference tables with data that is used by multiple schemas|
|Purchasing|Stock item purchases from suppliers and details about suppliers.|  
|Sales|Stock item sales to retail customers, and details about customers and sales people. |  
|Warehouse|Stock item inventory and transactions.|  

### Secure-access schemas

These schemas are used for external applications that are not allowed to access the data tables directly. They contain views and stored procedures used by external applications.

|Schema|Description|
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
|Website|All access to the database from the company website is through this schema.|
|Reports|All access to the database from Reporting Services reports is through this schema.|
|PowerBI|All access to the database from the Power BI dashboards via the Enterprise Gateway is through this schema.|

Note that the Reports and PowerBI schemas are not used in the initial release of the sample database. However, all Reporting Services and Power BI samples built on top of this database are encouraged to use these schemas.

### Development schemas

Special-purpose schemas

|Schema|Description|
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
|Integration|Objects and procedures required for data warehouse integration (i.e. migrating the data to the WideWorldImportersDW database).|
|Sequences|Holds sequences used by all tables in the application.|

## Tables

All tables in the database are in the data schemas.

## Design considerations

Database design is subjective and there is no right or wrong way to design a database. The schemas and tables in this database show ideas for how you can design your own database.

### Schema design

WideWorldImporters uses a small number of schemas so that it is easy to understand the database system and demonstrate database principles.  

Wherever possible, the database collocates tables that are commonly queried together into the same schema to minimize join complexity.

The database schema has been code-generated based on a series of metadata tables in another database WWI_Preparation. This gives WideWorldImporters a very high degree of design consistency, naming consistency, and completeness. For details on how the schema has been generated see the source code: [wide-world-importers/wwi-database-scripts](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/wide-world-importers/wwi-database-scripts)

### Table design

- All tables have single column primary keys for join simplicity.
- All schemas, tables, columns, indexes, and check constraints have a Description extended property that can be used to identify the purpose of the object or column. Memory-optimized tables are an exception to this since they don’t currently support extended properties.
- All foreign keys are automatically indexed unless there is another non-clustered index that has the same left-hand component.
- Auto-numbering in tables is based on sequences. These sequences are easier to work with across linked servers and similar environments than IDENTITY columns. Memory-optimized tables use IDENTITY columns since they don’t support in SQL Server 2016.
- A single sequence (TransactionID) is used for these tables: CustomerTransactions, SupplierTransactions, and StockItemTransactions. This demonstrates how a set of tables can have a single sequence.
- Some columns have appropriate default values.

### Security schemas

For security, WideWorldImporters does not allow external applications to access data schemas directly. To isolate access, WideWorldImporters uses security-access schemas that do not hold data, but contain views and stored procedures. External applications use the security schemas to retrieve the data that they are allowed to view.  This way, users can only run the views and stored procedures in the secure-access schemas

For example, this sample includes Power BI dashboards. An external application accesses these Power BI dashboards from the Power BI gateway as a user that has read-only permission on the PowerBI schema.  For read-only permission, the user only needs SELECT and EXECUTE permission on the PowerBI schema. A database administrator at WWI assigns these permissions as needed.

## Stored Procedures

Stored procedures are organized in schemas. Most of the schemas are used for configuration or sample purposes.

The `Website` schema contains the stored procedures that can be used by a Web front-end.

The `Reports` and `PowerBI` schemas are meant for reporting services and PowerBI purposes. Any extensions of the sample are encouraged to use these schemas for reporting purposes.

### Website schema

These are the procedures used by a client application, such as a Web front-end.

|Procedure|Purpose|
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
|ActivateWebsiteLogon|Allows a person (from `Application.People`) to have access to the website.|
|ChangePassword|Changes a user’s password (for users that are not using external authentication mechanisms).|
|InsertCustomerOrders|Allows inserting one or more customer orders (including the order lines).|
|InvoiceCustomerOrders|Takes a list of orders to be invoiced and processes the invoices.|
|RecordColdRoomTemperatures|Takes a sensor data list, as a table-valued parameter (TVP), and applies the data to the `Warehouse.ColdRoomTemperatures` temporal table.|
|RecordVehicleTemperature|Takes a JSON array and uses it to update `Warehouse.VehicleTemperatures`.|
|SearchForCustomers|Searches for customers by name or part of name (either the company name or the person name).|
|SearchForPeople|Searches for people by name or part of name.|
|SearchForStockItems|Searches for stock items by name or part of name or marketing comments.|
|SearchForStockItemsByTags|Searches for stock items by tags.|
|SearchForSuppliers|Searches for suppliers by name or part of name (either the company name or the person name).|

### Integration Schema

The stored procedures in this schema are used by the ETL process. They obtain the data needed from various tables for the timeframe required by the [ETL package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt734218.aspx).

### DataLoadSimulation Schema

Simulates a workload that inserts sales and purchases. The main stored procedure is `PopulateDataToCurrentDate`, which is used to insert sample data up to the current date.

|Procedure|Purpose|
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
|Configuration_ApplyDataLoadSimulationProcedures|Recreates the procedures needed for data load simulation. This is needed for bringing data up to the current date.|
|Configuration_RemoveDataLoadSimulationProcedures|This removes the procedures again after data simulation is complete.|
|DeactiveTemporalTablesBeforeDataLoad|Removes the temporal nature of all temporal tables and where applicable, applies a trigger so that changes can be made as though they were being applied at an earlier date than the sys-temporal tables allow.|
|PopulateDataToCurrentDate|Used to bring the data up to the current date. Should be run before any other configuration options after restoring the database from an initial backup.|
|ReactivateTemporalTablesAfterDataLoad|Re-establishes the temporal tables, including checking for data consistency. (Removes the associated triggers).|


### Application Schema

These procedures are used to configure the sample. They are used to apply enterprise edition features to the standard edition version of the sample, and also to add auditing and full-text indexing.

|Procedure|Purpose|
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
|AddRoleMemberIfNonexistant|Adds a member to a role if the member isn’t already in the role|
|Configuration_ApplyAuditing|Adds auditing. Server auditing is applied for standard edition databases; additional database auditing is added for enterprise edition.|
|Configuration_ApplyColumnstoreIndexing|Applies columnstore indexing to `Sales.OrderLines` and `Sales.InvoiceLines` and reindexes appropriately.|
|Configuration_ApplyFullTextIndexing|Applies fulltext indexes to `Application.People`, `Sales.Customers`, `Purchasing.Suppliers`, and `Warehouse.StockItems`. Replaces `Website.SearchForPeople`, `Website.SearchForSuppliers`, `Website.SearchForCustomers`, `Website.SearchForStockItems`, `Website.SearchForStockItemsByTags` with replacement procedures that use fulltext indexing.|
|Configuration_ApplyPartitioning|Applies table partitioning to `Sales.CustomerTransactions and `Purchasing.SupplierTransactions`, and rearranges the indexes to suit.|
|Configuration_ApplyRowLevelSecurity|Applies row level security to filter customers by sales territory related roles.|
|Configuration_ConfigureForEnterpriseEdition|Applies columnstore indexing, full text, in-memory, polybase, and partitioning.|
|Configuration_EnableInMemory|Adds a memory-optimized filegroup (when not working in Azure), replaces `Warehouse.ColdRoomTemperatures`, `Warehouse.VehicleTemperatures` with in-memory equivalents, and migrates the data, recreates the `Website.OrderIDList`, `Website.OrderList`, `Website.OrderLineList`, `Website.SensorDataList` table types with memory-optimized equivalents, drops and recreates the procedures `Website.InvoiceCustomerOrders`, `Website.InsertCustomerOrders`, and `Website.RecordColdRoomTemperatures` that uses these table types.|
|Configuration_RemoveAuditing|Removes the auditing configuration.|
|Configuration_RemoveRowLevelSecurity|Removes the row level security configuration (this is needed for changes to the associated tables).|
|CreateRoleIfNonExistant|Creates a database role if it doesn’t already exist.|


### Sequences Schema

Procedures to configure the sequences in the database.

|Procedure|Purpose|
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
|ReseedAllSequences|Calls the procedure ReseedSequenceBeyondTableValue for all sequences.|
|ReseedSequenceBeyondTableValue|Used to reposition the next sequence value beyond the value in any table that uses the same sequence. (Like a DBCC CHECKIDENT for identity columns equivalent for sequences but across potentially multiple tables).|
