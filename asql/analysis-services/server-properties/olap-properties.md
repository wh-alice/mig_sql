 The default value for this property is 10000 (rows).  
  
 **DimensionPropertyCacheSize**  
 A signed 32-bit integer property that specifies the amount of memory (in bytes) used to cache dimension members used in a query.  
  
 The default is 4,000,000 bytes (or 4 MB) per attribute hierarchy, per active query. The default value provides a well-balanced cache size for solutions having typical hierarchies. However, dimensions with a very large number of members (in the millions) or deep hierarchies perform better if you increase this value.  
  
 Implications of increasing cache size:  
  
-   Memory utilization costs increase when you allow more memory to be used by the dimension cache. Actual usage depends on query execution. Not all queries will use the allowable maximum.  
  
     Note that the memory used by these caches is considered nonshrinkable and will be included when accounting against the **TotalMemoryLimit**.  
  
-   Affects all databases on the server. **DimensionPropertyCachesize** is a server-wide property. Changing this property affects all databases running on the current instance.  
  
 Approach for estimating dimension cache requirements:  
  
1.  Start by increasing the size by a large number to determine whether there is a benefit to increasing the dimension cache size. For example, you might want to double the default value as an initial step.  
  
2.  If a performance improvement is evident, incrementally reduce the value until you reach a balance between performance and memory utilization.
