# Project Settings (Synchronization) (SybaseToSQL)
The Synchronization page of the **Project Settings** dialog box contains settings that customize how SSMA loads database objects, such as tables and stored procedures, into SQL Server or SQL Azure.  
  
You can access two different Synchronization pages that contain the same settings:  
  
-   If you want to specify settings for all future SSMA projects, on the **Tools** menu, select **Default Project Settings**, select migration project type for which settings are required to be viewed or changed from **Migration Target Version** drop down and then select **Synchronization** at the bottom of the left pane.  
  
-   To specify settings for the current project, on the **Tools** menu, select **Project Settings**, and then select **Synchronization** at the bottom of the left pane.  
  
## Options  
**Attempts**  
Specifies the number of attempts SSMA should make when it loads objects into SQL Server. Objects that are not loaded into SQL Server in the current attempt will be tried again until SSMA reaches the maximum number of attempts in the current synchronization process.  
  
## Synchronization for SQL Server  
**Refresh local object on local and remote object change**  
Specifies whether SSMA should replace the local object metadata with remote object metadata if both the local and remote objects change.  
If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA will load database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.  
If you select **Write to Database**, SSMA will update objects in the database according to SSMA metadata contents when the condition is met.  
If you select **Skip**, SSMA will not perform any refresh actions.   
Default option set is **Write to Database.**  
  
**Refresh local object on local object change**  
Specifies whether SSMA should replace the local object metadata with remote object metadata if the remote object changes.  
If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA will load database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.  
If you select **Write to Database**, SSMA will update the object in the database according to SSMA metadata contents when the condition is met.  
If you select **Skip**, SSMA will not perform any refresh actions.   
Default option set is **Write to Database**.  
  
**Refresh local object on Remote object change**  
Specifies whether SSMA should replace the local object metadata with remote object metadata if the remote object changes.  
If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA will load database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.  
If you select **Write to Database**, SSMA will update the object in the database according to SSMA metadata contents when the condition is met.  
If you select **Skip**, SSMA will not perform any refresh actions.   
Default option set is **Refresh from Database**.  
  
**Refresh when local object metadata is missing**  
Specifies whether SSMA should create local metadata if an object exists on the target database, but not locally.  
If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA selects the Refresh from Database option when the condition is met.  
If you select **Write to Database**, SSMA will delete the object from the database when the condition is met.  
If you select **Skip**, SSMA will not perform any refresh actions.   
Default option set is **Refresh from Database**.
