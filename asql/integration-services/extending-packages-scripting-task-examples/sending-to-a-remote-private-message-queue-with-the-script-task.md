# Sending to a Remote Private Message Queue with the Script Task
  Message Queuing (also known as MSMQ) makes it easy for developers to communicate with application programs quickly and reliably by sending and receiving messages. A message queue may be located on the local computer or a remote computer, and may be public or private. In [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)], the MSMQ connection manager and Message Queue task do not support sending to a private queue on a remote computer. However, by using the Script task, it is easy to send a message to a remote private queue.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to create a task that you can more easily reuse across multiple packages, consider using the code in this Script task sample as the starting point for a custom task. For more information, see [Developing a Custom Task](../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/task/developing-a-custom-task.md).  
  
## Description  
 The following example uses an existing MSMQ connection manager, together with objects and methods from the System.Messaging namespace, to send the text contained in a package variable to a remote private message queue. The call to the M:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.ManagedConnections.MSMQConn.AcquireConnection(System.Object) method of the MSMQ connection manager returns a **MessageQueue** object whose **Send** method accomplishes this task.  
  
#### To configure this Script Task example  
  
1.  Create an MSMQ connection manager with the default name. Set the path of a valid remote private queue, in the following format:  
  
    ```  
    FORMATNAME:DIRECT=OS:<computername>\private$\<queuename>  
    ```  
  
2.  Create an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] variable named **MessageText** of type **String** to pass the message text into the script. Enter a default message as the value of the variable.  
  
3.  Add a Script Task to the design surface and edit it. On the **Script** tab of the **Script Task Editor**, add the `MessageText` variable to the **ReadOnlyVariables** property to make the variable available inside the script.  
  
4.  Click **Edit Script** to open the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Tools for Applications (VSTA) script editor.  
  
5.  Add a reference in the script project to the **System.Messaging** namespace.  
  
6.  Replace the contents of the script window with the code in the following section.  
  
## Code  
  
```vb#  
Imports System  
Imports Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime  
Imports System.Messaging  
  
Public Class ScriptMain  
  
    Public Sub Main()  
  
        Dim remotePrivateQueue As MessageQueue  
        Dim messageText As String  
  
        remotePrivateQueue = _  
            DirectCast(Dts.Connections("Message Queue Connection Manager").AcquireConnection(Dts.Transaction), _  
            MessageQueue)  
        messageText = DirectCast(Dts.Variables("MessageText").Value, String)  
        remotePrivateQueue.Send(messageText)  
  
        Dts.TaskResult = ScriptResults.Success  
  
    End Sub  
  
End Class  
```  
  
```c#  
using System;  
using Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime;  
using System.Messaging;  
  
public class ScriptMain  
{  
  
    public void Main()  
        {  
  
            MessageQueue remotePrivateQueue = new MessageQueue();  
            string messageText;  
  
            remotePrivateQueue = (MessageQueue)(Dts.Connections["Message Queue Connection Manager"].AcquireConnection(Dts.Transaction) as MessageQueue);  
            messageText = (string)(Dts.Variables["MessageText"].Value);  
            remotePrivateQueue.Send(messageText);  
  
            Dts.TaskResult = (int)ScriptResults.Success;  
  
        }  
  
}  
```
