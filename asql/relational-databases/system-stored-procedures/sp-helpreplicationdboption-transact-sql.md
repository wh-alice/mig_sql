 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_helpreplicationdboption [ [ @dbname =] 'dbname' ]  
    [ , [ @type = ] 'type' ]  
    [ , [ @reserved = ] reserved ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@dbname=**] **'***dbname***'**  
 Is the name of the database. *dbname* is **sysname**, with a default of **%**. If **%**, then the result set contains all databases at the Publisher, otherwise only information on the specified database is returned. Information is not returned for any databases on which the user does not have the appropriate permissions, as described below.  
  
 [ **@type=**]  **'***type***'**  
 Restricts the result set to contain only databases on which the specified replication option *type* value has been enabled. *type* is **sysname**, and can be one of the following values.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**publish**|Transactional replication allowed.|  
|**merge publish**|Merge replication allowed.|  
|**replication allowed** (default)|Either transactional or merge replication allowed.|  
  
 [ **@reserved=** ] *reserved*  
 Specifies whether information on existing publications and subscriptions is returned. *reserved* is **bit**, with a default value of 0. If **1**, the result set includes information on whether the database specified has any existing publications or subscriptions.  
  
## Result Sets  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**name**|**sysname**|Name of the database.|  
|**id**|**int**|Database identifier.|  
|**transpublish**|**bit**|If the database has been enabled for snapshot or transactional publishing; where a value of **1** means that snapshot or transactional publishing is enabled.|  
|**mergepublish**|**bit**|If the database has been enabled for merge publishing; where a value of **1** means that merge publishing is enabled.|  
|**dbowner**|**bit**|If the user is a member of the **db_owner** fixed database role; where a value of **1** indicates that the user is a member of this role.|  
|**dbreadonly**|**bit**|Is if the database is marked as read-only; where a value of **1** means that the database is read-only.|  
|**haspublications**|**bit**|Is if the database has any existing publications; where a value of **1** means that there are existing publications.|  
|**haspullsubscriptions**|**bit**|Is if the database has any existing pull subscriptions; where a value of **1** means that there are existing pull subscriptions.|  
  
## Return Code Values
