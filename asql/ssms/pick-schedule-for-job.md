# Pick Schedule for Job
Use this dialog to pick an existing schedule for the Microsoft SQL Server Agent job.  
  
## Options  
**Available schedules**  
Lists the schedules available for this job. Because a job and a schedule must have the same owner, this list only includes schedules owned by the owner of the job.  
  
**Name**  
Displays the name of the schedule.  
  
**Enabled**  
Selected if the schedule is enabled.  
  
**Description**  
Describes the conditions under which the schedule runs the job.  
  
**Jobs in schedule**  
Lists the job numbers attached to the schedule. Click a number to view the properties of the job.  
  
**Properties**  
Launches the **Job Schedule Properties** dialog where you can view information about the schedule.
