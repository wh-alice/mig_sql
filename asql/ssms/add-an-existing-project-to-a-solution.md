# Add an Existing Project to a Solution
You can add one or more projects to an existing solution. A project can be associated with more than one solution.  
  
### To add an existing project to a solution  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select the solution.  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **Add**, and click **Existing Project**.  
  
3.  In the **Add Existing Project** dialog box, locate the project you want to add, select the project file, and then click **Open**.  
  
    The project is added to the selected solution.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Before adding an existing project from shared directories in a multideveloper environment, you should attempt to ensure that your changes do not adversely affect or overwrite another developer's changes.
