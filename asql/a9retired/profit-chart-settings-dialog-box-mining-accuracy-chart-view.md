# Profit Chart Settings Dialog Box (Mining Accuracy Chart View)
  Use the **Profit Chart Settings** dialog box to configure settings for generating a profit chart. For more information about profit charts, see [Lift Chart &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../analysis-services/data-mining/lift-chart-analysis-services-data-mining.md).  
  
## Options
