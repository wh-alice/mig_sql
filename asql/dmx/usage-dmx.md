# Usage (DMX)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  When you use Data Mining Extensions (DMX) to define a new data mining model in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], you must specify how the data mining algorithm that builds the model will use each column. You can specify a column as one of the following types:  
  
-   **Key**  
  
-   **Key Sequence**  
  
-   **Key Time**  
  
-   **Predict**  
  
-   **PredictOnly**  
  
 Columns that are left unspecified in DMX are treated as input columns.  
  
 To process a model correctly, the algorithm must know which column is the key column that uniquely identifies each row, which column is the target column for creating predictions if you are creating a predictable model, and which columns to use as input columns to create the relationships that predict the target column.  
  
 Columns that are specified as the **Predict** type are used as both input and output columns. Columns that are specified as **PredictOnly** are only used as output columns. Specific algorithms may treat Predict columns differently.  
  
 For more information about the column usage types that [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] supports, see [Mining Model Columns](../analysis-services/data-mining/mining-model-columns.md).
