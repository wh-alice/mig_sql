# Add an Expression (Report Builder and SSRS)
  Expressions are used throughout a report for defining report item properties, filters, groups, sort order, connection strings, and parameter values. Expressions begin with an equal sign (=) and are written in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/vbprvb-md.md)]. They are evaluated at run time by the report processor, which combines the evaluation result with report layout elements.  
  
 Expressions can be simple or complex. Simple expression refer to a single item in a built-in collection. Complex expressions can contain constants, operators, global collection items, and function calls. For more information, see [Expressions &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/expressions-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).

### To add an expression to a text box  
  
-   In **Design** view, click the text box on the design surface to which you want to add an expression.  
  
    -   For a simple expression, type the display text for the expression in the text box. For example, for the dataset field Sales, type `[Sales]`.  
  
    -   For a complex expression, right-click the text box, and select **Expression**. The **Expression** dialog box opens. Type or interactively create your expression after the '=' in the expression pane, and then click OK.  
  
         The expression appears on the design surface as `<<Expr>>`.
