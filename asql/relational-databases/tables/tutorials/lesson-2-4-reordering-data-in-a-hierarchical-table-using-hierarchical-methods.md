# Lesson 2-4 - Reordering Data in a Hierarchical Table Using Hierarchical Methods
Reorganizing a hierarchy is a common maintenance task. In this task, we will use an UPDATE statement with the [GetReparentedValue](../../../t-sql/data-types/getreparentedvalue-database-engine.md) method to first move a single row to a new location in the hierarchy. Then we will move an entire sub-tree to a new location.  
  
The `GetReparentedValue` method takes two arguments. The first argument describes the part of the hierarchy to be modified. For example, if a hierarchy is **/1/4/2/3/** and you want to change the **/1/4/** section, the hierarchy becomes **/2/1/2/3/**, leaving the last two nodes (**2/3/**) unchanged, you must provide the changing nodes (**/1/4/**) as the first argument. The second argument provides the new hierarchy level, in our example **/2/1/**. The two arguments do not have to contain the same number of levels.  
  
### To move a single row to a new location in the hierarchy  
  
1.  Currently Wanida reports to Sariya. In this procedure, you move Wanida from her current node **/1/1/,** so that she reports to Jill. Her new node will become **/3/1/** so **/1/** is the first argument and **/3/** is the second. These correspond to the **OrgNode** values of Sariya and Jill. Execute the following code to move Wanida from Sariya's organization to Jill's:  
  
    ```  
    DECLARE @CurrentEmployee hierarchyid , @OldParent hierarchyid, @NewParent hierarchyid  
    SELECT @CurrentEmployee = OrgNode FROM HumanResources.EmployeeOrg  
      WHERE EmployeeID = 269 ;   
    SELECT @OldParent = OrgNode FROM HumanResources.EmployeeOrg  
      WHERE EmployeeID = 46 ;   
    SELECT @NewParent = OrgNode FROM HumanResources.EmployeeOrg  
      WHERE EmployeeID = 119 ;   
  
    UPDATE HumanResources.EmployeeOrg  
    SET OrgNode = @CurrentEmployee. GetReparentedValue(@OldParent, @NewParent)   
    WHERE OrgNode = @CurrentEmployee ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
2.  Execute the following code to see the result:  
  
    ```  
    SELECT OrgNode.ToString() AS Text_OrgNode,   
    OrgNode, OrgLevel, EmployeeID, EmpName, Title   
    FROM HumanResources.EmployeeOrg ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
    Wanida is now at node **/3/1/**.  
  
### To reorganize a section of a hierarchy  
  
1.  To demonstrate how to move a larger number of people at the same time, first execute the following code to add an intern reporting to Wanida:  
  
    ```  
    EXEC AddEmp 269, 291, 'Kevin', 'Marketing Intern'  ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
2.  Now Kevin reports to Wanida, who reports to Jill, who reports to David. That means that Kevin is at level **/3/1/1/**. To move all of Jill's subordinates to a new manager, we will update all nodes that have **/3/** as their **OrgNode** to a new value. Execute the following code to update Wanida to report to Sariya, but keep  Kevin reporting to Wanida:  
  
    ```  
    DECLARE @OldParent hierarchyid, @NewParent hierarchyid  
    SELECT @OldParent = OrgNode FROM HumanResources.EmployeeOrg  
    WHERE EmployeeID = 119 ; -- Jill  
    SELECT @NewParent = OrgNode FROM HumanResources.EmployeeOrg  
    WHERE EmployeeID = 46 ; -- Sariya  
    DECLARE children_cursor CURSOR FOR  
    SELECT OrgNode FROM HumanResources.EmployeeOrg  
    WHERE OrgNode.GetAncestor(1) = @OldParent;  
    DECLARE @ChildId hierarchyid;  
    OPEN children_cursor  
    FETCH NEXT FROM children_cursor INTO @ChildId;  
    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0  
    BEGIN  
    START:  
        DECLARE @NewId hierarchyid;  
        SELECT @NewId = @NewParent.GetDescendant(MAX(OrgNode), NULL)  
        FROM HumanResources.EmployeeOrg WHERE OrgNode.GetAncestor(1) = @NewParent;  
  
        UPDATE HumanResources.EmployeeOrg  
        SET OrgNode = OrgNode.GetReparentedValue(@ChildId, @NewId)  
        WHERE OrgNode.IsDescendantOf(@ChildId) = 1;  
        IF @@error <> 0 GOTO START -- On error, retry  
            FETCH NEXT FROM children_cursor INTO @ChildId;  
    END  
    CLOSE children_cursor;  
    DEALLOCATE children_cursor;  
  
    ```  
  
3.  Execute the following code to see the result:  
  
    ```  
    SELECT OrgNode.ToString() AS Text_OrgNode,   
    OrgNode, OrgLevel, EmployeeID, EmpName, Title   
    FROM HumanResources.EmployeeOrg ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
```  
Text_OrgNode OrgNode OrgLevel EmployeeID EmpName Title  
------------ ------- -------- ---------- ------- -----------------  
/            Ox      0        6          David   Marketing Manager  
/1/          0x58    1        46         Sariya  Marketing Specialist  
/1/1/        0x5AC0  2        269        Wanida  Marketing Assistant  
/1/1//2      0x5AD0  3        291        Kevin   Marketing Intern  
/2/          0x68    1        271        John    Marketing Specialist  
/2/1/        0x6AC0  2        272        Mary    Marketing Assistant  
/3/          0x78    1        119        Jill    Marketing Specialist  
```  
  
The entire organizational tree that had reported to Jill (both Wanida and Kevin) now reports to Sariya.
