## Return Types  
 **sql_variant**  
  
## Remarks  
  
### ServerName Property  
 The `ServerName` property of the `SERVERPROPERTY` function and [@@SERVERNAME](../../t-sql/functions/servername-transact-sql.md) return similar information. The `ServerName` property provides the Windows server and instance name that together make up the unique server instance. [@@SERVERNAME](../../t-sql/functions/servername-transact-sql.md) provides the currently configured local server name.  
  
 The `ServerName` property and [@@SERVERNAME](../../t-sql/functions/servername-transact-sql.md) return the same information if the default server name at the time of installation has not been changed. The local server name can be configured by executing the following:  
  
```  
EXEC sp_dropserver 'current_server_name';  
GO  
EXEC sp_addserver 'new_server_name', 'local';  
GO  
```  
  
 If the local server name has been changed from the default server name at installation time, [@@SERVERNAME](../../t-sql/functions/servername-transact-sql.md) returns the new name.  
  
### Version Properties  
 The `SERVERPROPERTY` function returns individual properties that relate to the version information whereas the [@@VERSION](../Topic/@@VERSION%20\(Transact-SQL\).md) function combines the output into one string. If your application requires individual property strings, you can use the `SERVERPROPERTY` function to return them instead of parsing the [@@VERSION](../Topic/@@VERSION%20\(Transact-SQL\).md) results.  

## Permissions

All users can query the server properties. 
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses the `SERVERPROPERTY` function in a `SELECT` statement to return information about the current instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].   
  
```  
SELECT  
  SERVERPROPERTY('MachineName') AS ComputerName,
  SERVERPROPERTY('ServerName') AS InstanceName,  
  SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') AS Edition,
  SERVERPROPERTY('ProductVersion') AS ProductVersion,  
  SERVERPROPERTY('ProductLevel') AS ProductLevel;  
GO  
```
