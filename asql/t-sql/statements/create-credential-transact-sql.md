# CREATE CREDENTIAL (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Creates a server-level credential. A credential is a record that contains the authentication information that is required to connect to a resource outside SQL Server. Most credentials include a Windows user and password. For example, saving a database backup to some location might require SQL Server to provide special credentials to access that location. For more information, see [Credentials (Database Engine)](../../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/credentials-database-engine.md).
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To make the credential  at the database-level use [CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-database-scoped-credential-transact-sql.md). Use a server-level credential when you need to use the same credential for multiple databases on the server. Use a database-scoped credential to make the database more portable. When a database is moved to a new server, the database scoped credential will move with it. Use database scoped credentials on [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)].  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
CREATE CREDENTIAL credential_name   
WITH IDENTITY = 'identity_name'  
    [ , SECRET = 'secret' ]  
        [ FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER cryptographic_provider_name ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *credential_name*  
 Specifies the name of the credential being created. *credential_name* cannot start with the number (#) sign. System credentials start with ##.  When using a shared access signature (SAS), this name must match the container path, start with https and must not contain a forward slash. See example D below.  
  
 IDENTITY **='***identity_name***'**  
 Specifies the name of the account to be used when connecting outside the server. When the credential is used to access the Azure Key Vault, the **IDENTITY** is the name of the key vault. See example C below. When the credential is using a shared access signature (SAS), the **IDENTITY** is *SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE*. See example D below.  
  
 SECRET **='***secret***'**  
 Specifies the secret required for outgoing authentication.  
  
 When the credential is used to access the Azure Key Vault the **SECRET** argument of **CREATE CREDENTIAL** requires the *\<Client ID>* (without hyphens) and *\<Secret>* of a **Service Principal** in the Azure Active Directory to be passed together without a space between them. See example C below. When the credential is using a shared access signature, the **SECRET** is the shared access signature token. See example D below.  For information about creating a stored access policy and a shared access signature on an Azure container, see [Lesson 1: Create a stored access policy and a shared access signature  on an Azure container](../../relational-databases/tutorials/41674d9d-8132-4bff-be4d-85a861419f3d.md).  
  
 FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER *cryptographic_provider_name*  
 Specifies the name of an *Enterprise Key Management Provider (EKM)*. For more information about Key Management, see [Extensible Key Management &#40;EKM&#41;](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/extensible-key-management-ekm.md).  
  
## Remarks  

 When IDENTITY is a Windows user, the secret can be the password. The secret is encrypted using the service master key. If the service master key is regenerated, the secret is re-encrypted using the new service master key.  
  
 After creating a credential, you can map it to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login by using [CREATE LOGIN](../../t-sql/statements/create-login-transact-sql.md) or [ALTER LOGIN](../../t-sql/statements/alter-login-transact-sql.md). A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login can be mapped to only one credential, but a single credential can be mapped to multiple [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] logins. For more information, see [Credentials &#40;Database Engine&#41;](../../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/credentials-database-engine.md). A server-level credential can only be mapped to a login, not to a database user. 
  
 Information about credentials is visible in the [sys.credentials](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys.credentials-transact-sql.md) catalog view.  
  
 If there is no login mapped credential for the provider, the credential mapped to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service account is used.  
  
 A login can have multiple credentials mapped to it as long as they are used with distinctive providers. There must be only one mapped credential per provider per login. The same credential can be mapped to other logins.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires **ALTER ANY CREDENTIAL** permission.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Basic Example  
 The following example creates the credential called `AlterEgo`. The credential contains the Windows user `Mary5` and a password.  
  
```  
CREATE CREDENTIAL AlterEgo WITH IDENTITY = 'Mary5',   
    SECRET = '<EnterStrongPasswordHere>';  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Creating a Credential for EKM  
 The following example uses a previously created account called `User1OnEKM` on an EKM module through the EKMâ€™s Management tools, with a basic account type and password. The **sysadmin** account on the server creates a credential that is used to connect to the EKM account, and assigns it to the `User1`[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] account:  
  
```  
CREATE CREDENTIAL CredentialForEKM  
    WITH IDENTITY='User1OnEKM', SECRET='<EnterStrongPasswordHere>'  
    FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER MyEKMProvider;  
GO  
  
/* Modify the login to assign the cryptographic provider credential */  
ALTER LOGIN Login1  
ADD CREDENTIAL CredentialForEKM;  
  
/* Modify the login to assign a non cryptographic provider credential */   
ALTER LOGIN Login1  
WITH CREDENTIAL = AlterEgo;  
GO  
```  
  
### C. Creating a Credential for EKM Using the Azure Key Vault  
 The following example creates a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] credential for the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] to use when accessing the Azure Key Vault using the **SQL Server Connector for Microsoft Azure Key Vault**. For a complete example of using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Connector, see [Extensible Key Management Using Azure Key Vault &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/extensible-key-management-using-azure-key-vault-sql-server.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The **IDENTITY** argument of **CREATE CREDENTIAL** requires the key vault name. The **SECRET** argument of **CREATE CREDENTIAL** requires the *\<Client ID>* (without hyphens) and *\<Secret>* to be passed together without a space between them.  
  
 In the following example, the **Client ID** (`EF5C8E09-4D2A-4A76-9998-D93440D8115D`) is stripped of the hyphens and entered as the string `EF5C8E094D2A4A769998D93440D8115D` and the **Secret** is represented by the string *SECRET_DBEngine*.  
  
```  
USE master;  
CREATE CREDENTIAL Azure_EKM_TDE_cred   
    WITH IDENTITY = 'ContosoKeyVault',   
    SECRET = 'EF5C8E094D2A4A769998D93440D8115DSECRET_DBEngine'   
    FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER AzureKeyVault_EKM_Prov ;  
```  
  
 The following example creates the same credential by using variables for the **Client ID** and **Secret** strings, which are then concatenated together to form the **SECRET** argument. The **REPLACE** function is used to remove the hyphens from the Client ID.  
  
```  
DECLARE @AuthClientId uniqueidentifier = 'EF5C8E09-4D2A-4A76-9998-D93440D8115D';  
DECLARE @AuthClientSecret varchar(200) = 'SECRET_DBEngine';  
DECLARE @pwd varchar(max) = REPLACE(CONVERT(varchar(36), @AuthClientId) , '-', '') + @AuthClientSecret;  
  
EXEC ('CREATE CREDENTIAL Azure_EKM_TDE_cred   
    WITH IDENTITY = 'ContosoKeyVault', SECRET = ''' + @PWD + '''   
    FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER AzureKeyVault_EKM_Prov ;');  
```  
  
### D. Creating a Credential using a SAS Token  
 **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [current version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299658).  
  
 The following example creates a shared access signature credential using a SAS token.  For a tutorial on creating a stored access policy and a shared access signature on an Azure container, and then creating a credential using the shared access signature, see [Tutorial: Using the Microsoft Azure Blob storage service with SQL Server 2016 databases](Tutorial:%20Using%20the%20Microsoft%20Azure%20Blob%20storage%20service%20with%20SQL%20Server%202016%20databases.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  THE **CREDENTIAL NAME** argument requires that the name match the container path, start with https and not contain a trailing forward slash. The **IDENTITY** argument requires the name, *SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE*. The **SECRET** argument requires the shared access signature token.  
  
```  
USE master  
CREATE CREDENTIAL 'https://<mystorageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net/<mystorageaccountcontainername>' -- this name must match the container path, start with https and must not contain a trailing forward slash.  
   WITH IDENTITY='SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE' -- this is a mandatory string and do not change it.   
   , SECRET = 'sharedaccesssignature' â€“- this is the shared access signature token   
GO    
```
