## Arguments  
 *schema_name*  
 Is the name of the schema to which the user-defined function belongs.  
  
 *function_name*  
 Is the user-defined function to be changed.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Parentheses are required after the function name even if a parameter is not specified.  
  
 **@** *parameter_name*  
 Is a parameter in the user-defined function. One or more parameters can be declared.  
  
 A function can have a maximum of 2,100 parameters. The value of each declared parameter must be supplied by the user when the function is executed, unless a default for the parameter is defined.  
  
 Specify a parameter name by using an at sign (**@**) as the first character. The parameter name must comply with the rules for [identifiers](../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md). Parameters are local to the function; the same parameter names can be used in other functions. Parameters can take the place only of constants; they cannot be used instead of table names, column names, or the names of other database objects.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  ANSI_WARNINGS is not honored when passing parameters in a stored procedure, user-defined function, or when declaring and setting variables in a batch statement. For example, if a variable is defined as **char(3)**, and then set to a value larger than three characters, the data is truncated to the defined size and the INSERT or UPDATE statement succeeds.  
  
 [ *type_schema_name.* ] *parameter_data_type*  
 Is the parameter data type and optionally, the schema to which it belongs. For [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except the **timestamp** data type. For CLR functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except **text**, **ntext**, **image**, and **timestamp** data types. The nonscalar types **cursor** and **table** cannot be specified as a parameter data type in either [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] or CLR functions.  
  
 If *type_schema_name* is not specified, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEversion2005](../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/includes/ssdeversion2005-md.md)] looks for the *parameter_data_type* in the following order:  
  
-   The schema that contains the names of SQL Server system data types.  
  
-   The default schema of the current user in the current database.  
  
-   The **dbo** schema in the current database.  
  
 [ **=***default* ]  
 Is a default value for the parameter. If a *default* value is defined, the function can be executed without specifying a value for that parameter.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Default parameter values can be specified for CLR functions except for **varchar(max)** and **varbinary(max)** data types.  
  
 When a parameter of the function has a default value, the keyword DEFAULT must be specified when calling the function to retrieve the default value. This behavior is different from using parameters with default values in stored procedures in which omitting the parameter also implies the default value.  
  
 *return_data_type*  
 Is the return value of a scalar user-defined function. For [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except the **timestamp** data type. For CLR functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except **text**, **ntext**, **image**, and **timestamp** data types. The nonscalar types **cursor** and **table** cannot be specified as a return data type in either [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] or CLR functions.  
  
 *function_body*  
 Specifies that a series of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, which together do not produce a side effect such as modifying a table, define the value of the function. *function_body* is used only in scalar functions and multistatement table-valued functions.  
  
 In scalar functions, *function_body* is a series of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that together evaluate to a scalar value.  
  
 In multistatement table-valued functions, *function_body* is a series of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that populate a TABLE return variable.  
  
 *scalar_expression*  
 Specifies that the scalar function returns a scalar value.  
  
 TABLE  
 Specifies that the return value of the table-valued function is a table. Only constants and **@***local_variables* can be passed to table-valued functions.  
  
 In inline table-valued functions, the TABLE return value is defined through a single SELECT statement. Inline functions do not have associated return variables.  
  
 In multistatement table-valued functions, **@***return_variable* is a TABLE variable used to store and accumulate the rows that should be returned as the value of the function. **@***return_variable* can be specified only for [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions and not for CLR functions.  
  
 *select-stmt*  
 Is the single SELECT statement that defines the return value of an inline table-valued function.  
  
 EXTERNAL NAME <method_specifier>*assembly_name.class_name*.*method_name*  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../a9notintoc/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Specifies the method of an assembly to bind with the function. *assembly_name* must match an existing assembly in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in the current database with visibility on. *class_name* must be a valid [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] identifier and must exist as a class in the assembly. If the class has a namespace-qualified name that uses a period (**.**) to separate namespace parts, the class name must be delimited by using brackets (**[]**) or quotation marks (**""**). *method_name* must be a valid [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] identifier and must exist as a static method in the specified class.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  By default, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cannot execute CLR code. You can create, modify, and drop database objects that reference common language runtime modules; however, you cannot execute these references in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] until you enable the [clr enabled option](../../database-engine/configure/windows/clr-enabled-server-configuration-option.md). To enable the option, use [sp_configure](../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is not available in a contained database.  
  
 *\<*table_type_definition*>***(** { <column_definition> <column_constraint>   | <computed_column_definition> }   [ <table_constraint> ] [ **,**...*n* ]**)**  
 Defines the table data type for a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] function. The table declaration includes column definitions and column or table constraints.  
  
 \< clr_table_type_definition > **(** { *column_name**data_type* } [ **,**...*n* ] **)**  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../a9notintoc/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[sqldbesa](../../a9retired/includes/sqldbesa-md.md)] ([Preview in some regions](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-preview-whats-new/?WT.mc_id=TSQL_GetItTag)).|  
  
 Defines the table data types for a CLR function. The table declaration includes only column names and data types.  
  
 NULL|NOT NULL  
 Supported only for natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions. For more information, see [Scalar User-Defined Functions for In-Memory OLTP](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/scalar-user-defined-functions-for-in-memory-oltp.md).  
  
 NATIVE_COMPILATION  
 Indicates whether a user-defined function is natively compiled. This argument is required for natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions.  
  
 The NATIVE_COMPILATION argument is required when you ALTER the function, and can only be used, if the function was created with the NATIVE_COMPILATION argument.  
  
 BEGIN ATOMIC WITH  
 Supported only for natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions, and is required. For more information, see [Atomic Blocks](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/atomic-blocks-in-native-procedures.md).  
  
 SCHEMABINDING  
 The SCHEMABINDING argument is required for natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions.  
  
 **<function_option>::= and <clr_function_option>::=**  
  
 Specifies the function will have one or more of the following options.  
  
 ENCRYPTION  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../a9notintoc/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Indicates that the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] encrypts the catalog view columns that contains the text of the ALTER FUNCTION statement. Using ENCRYPTION prevents the function from being published as part of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] replication. ENCRYPTION cannot be specified for CLR functions.  
  
 SCHEMABINDING  
 Specifies that the function is bound to the database objects that it references. This condition will prevent changes to the function if other schema bound objects are referencing it.  
  
 The binding of the function to the objects it references is removed only when one of the following actions occurs:  
  
-   The function is dropped.  
  
-   The function is modified by using the ALTER statement with the SCHEMABINDING option not specified.  
  
 For a list of conditions that must be met before a function can be schema bound, see [CREATE FUNCTION &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-function-transact-sql.md).  
  
 RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT | CALLED ON NULL INPUT  
 Specifies the **OnNULLCall** attribute of a scalar-valued function. If not specified, CALLED ON NULL INPUT is implied by default. This means that the function body executes even if NULL is passed as an argument.  
  
 If RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT is specified in a CLR function, it indicates that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can return NULL when any of the arguments it receives is NULL, without actually invoking the body of the function. If the method specified in <method_specifier> already has a custom attribute that indicates RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT, but the ALTER FUNCTION statement indicates CALLED ON NULL INPUT, the ALTER FUNCTION statement takes precedence. The **OnNULLCall** attribute cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 EXECUTE AS Clause  
 Specifies the security context under which the user-defined function is executed. Therefore, you can control which user account [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses to validate permissions on any database objects referenced by the function.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  EXECUTE AS cannot be specified for inline user-defined functions.  
  
 For more information, see [EXECUTE AS Clause &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/execute-as-clause-transact-sql.md).  
  
 **\< column_definition >::=**  
  
 Defines the table data type. The table declaration includes column definitions and constraints. For CLR functions, only *column_name* and *data_type* can be specified.  
  
 *column_name*  
 Is the name of a column in the table. Column names must comply with the rules for identifiers and must be unique in the table. *column_name* can consist of 1 through 128 characters.  
  
 *data_type*  
 Specifies the column data type. For [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except **timestamp**. For CLR functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except **text**, **ntext**, **image**, **char**, **varchar**, **varchar(max)**, and **timestamp**.The nonscalar type **cursor** cannot be specified as a column data type in either [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] or CLR functions.  
  
 DEFAULT *constant_expression*  
 Specifies the value provided for the column when a value is not explicitly supplied during an insert. *constant_expression* is a constant, NULL, or a system function value. DEFAULT definitions can be applied to any column except those that have the IDENTITY property. DEFAULT cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 COLLATE *collation_name*  
 Specifies the collation for the column. If not specified, the column is assigned the default collation of the database. Collation name can be either a Windows collation name or a SQL collation name. For a list of and more information, see [Windows Collation Name &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/windows-collation-name-transact-sql.md) and [SQL Server Collation Name &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/sql-server-collation-name-transact-sql.md).  
  
 The COLLATE clause can be used to change the collations only of columns of the **char**, **varchar**, **nchar**, and **nvarchar** data types.  
  
 COLLATE cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 ROWGUIDCOL  
 Indicates that the new column is a row global unique identifier column. Only one **uniqueidentifier** column per table can be designated as the ROWGUIDCOL column. The ROWGUIDCOL property can be assigned only to a **uniqueidentifier** column.  
  
 The ROWGUIDCOL property does not enforce uniqueness of the values stored in the column. It also does not automatically generate values for new rows inserted into the table. To generate unique values for each column, use the NEWID function on INSERT statements. A default value can be specified; however, NEWID cannot be specified as the default.  
  
 IDENTITY  
 Indicates that the new column is an identity column. When a new row is added to the table, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides a unique, incremental value for the column. Identity columns are typically used together with PRIMARY KEY constraints to serve as the unique row identifier for the table. The IDENTITY property can be assigned to **tinyint**, **smallint**, **int**, **bigint**, **decimal(p,0)**, or **numeric(p,0)** columns. Only one identity column can be created per table. Bound defaults and DEFAULT constraints cannot be used with an identity column. You must specify both the *seed* and *increment* or neither. If neither is specified, the default is (1,1).  
  
 IDENTITY cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 *seed*  
 Is the integer value to be assigned to the first row in the table.  
  
 *increment*  
 Is the integer value to add to the *seed* value for successive rows in the table.  
  
 **\< column_constraint >::= and \< table_constraint>::=**  
  
 Defines the constraint for a specified column or table. For CLR functions, the only constraint type allowed is NULL. Named constraints are not allowed.  
  
 NULL | NOT NULL  
 Determines whether null values are allowed in the column. NULL is not strictly a constraint but can be specified just like NOT NULL. NOT NULL cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 PRIMARY KEY  
 Is a constraint that enforces entity integrity for a specified column through a unique index. In table-valued user-defined functions, the PRIMARY KEY constraint can be created on only one column per table. PRIMARY KEY cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 UNIQUE  
 Is a constraint that provides entity integrity for a specified column or columns through a unique index. A table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints. UNIQUE cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 CLUSTERED | NONCLUSTERED  
 Indicate that a clustered or a nonclustered index is created for the PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint. PRIMARY KEY constraints use CLUSTERED, and UNIQUE constraints use NONCLUSTERED.  
  
 CLUSTERED can be specified for only one constraint. If CLUSTERED is specified for a UNIQUE constraint and a PRIMARY KEY constraint is also specified, the PRIMARY KEY uses NONCLUSTERED.  
  
 CLUSTERED and NONCLUSTERED cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 CHECK  
 Is a constraint that enforces domain integrity by limiting the possible values that can be entered into a column or columns. CHECK constraints cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 *logical_expression*  
 Is a logical expression that returns TRUE or FALSE.  
  
 **<computed_column_definition>::=**  
  
 Specifies a computed column. For more information about computed columns, see [CREATE TABLE &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-table-transact-sql.md).  
  
 *column_name*  
 Is the name of the computed column.  
  
 *computed_column_expression*  
 Is an expression that defines the value of a computed column.  
  
 **<index_option>::=**  
  
 Specifies the index options for the PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE index. For more information about index options, see [CREATE INDEX &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-index-transact-sql.md).  
  
 PAD_INDEX = { ON | OFF }  
 Specifies index padding. The default is OFF.  
  
 FILLFACTOR = *fillfactor*  
 Specifies a percentage that indicates how full the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] should make the leaf level of each index page during index creation or change. *fillfactor* must be an integer value from 1 to 100. The default is 0.  
  
 IGNORE_DUP_KEY = { ON | OFF }  
 Specifies the error response when an insert operation attempts to insert duplicate key values into a unique index. The IGNORE_DUP_KEY option applies only to insert operations after the index is created or rebuilt. The default is OFF.  
  
 STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = { ON | OFF }  
 Specifies whether distribution statistics are recomputed. The default is OFF.  
  
 ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = { ON | OFF }  
 Specifies whether row locks are allowed. The default is ON.  
  
 ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = { ON | OFF }  
 Specifies whether page locks are allowed. The default is ON.  
  
## Remarks  
 ALTER FUNCTION cannot be used to change a scalar-valued function to a table-valued function, or vice versa. Also, ALTER FUNCTION cannot be used to change an inline function to a multistatement function, or vice versa. ALTER FUNCTION cannot be used to change a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] function to a CLR function or vice-versa.  
  
 The following Service Broker statements cannot be included in the definition of a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] user-defined function:  
  
-   BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION  
  
-   END CONVERSATION  
  
-   GET CONVERSATION GROUP  
  
-   MOVE CONVERSATION  
  
-   RECEIVE  
  
-   SEND  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires ALTER permission on the function or on the schema. If the function specifies a user-defined type, requires EXECUTE permission on the type.
