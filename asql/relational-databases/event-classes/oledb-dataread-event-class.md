# OLEDB DataRead Event Class
  The OLEDB DataRead event class occurs when [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] calls an OLE DB provider for distributed queries and remote stored procedures. Include this event class in traces that monitor when [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] makes a data request call to the OLE DB provider.  
  
 When the OLEDB DataRead class is included in a trace, the amount of overhead incurred will be high. It is recommended that you limit the use of this event class to traces that monitor specific problems for brief periods of time.  
  
## OLEDB DataRead Event Class Data Columns  
  
|Data column name|Data type|Description|Column ID|Filterable|  
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|  
|ApplicationName|**nvarchar**|Name of the client application that created the connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This column is populated with the values passed by the application rather than the displayed name of the program.|10|Yes|  
|ClientProcessID|**int**|ID assigned by the host computer to the process where the client application is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the client process ID.|9|Yes|  
|DatabaseID|**int**|ID of the database specified by the USE *database* statement or the default database if no USE *database*statement has been issued for a given instance. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the ServerName data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|  
|DatabaseName|**nvarchar**|Name of the database in which the user statement is running.|35|Yes|  
|Duration|**bigint**|Length of time to complete the OLE DB Call event.|13|No|  
|EndTime|**datetime**|Time the event ended.|15|Yes|  
|Error|**int**|Error number of a given event. Often this is the error number stored in the sys.messages catalog view.|31|Yes|  
|EventClass|**int**|Type of event = 121.|27|No|  
|EventSequence|**int**|Sequence of OLE DB event class in batch.|51|No|  
|EventSubClass|**int**|Type of event subclass.<br /><br /> 0=Starting<br /><br /> 1=Completed|21|No|  
|GroupID|**int**|ID of the workload group where the SQL Trace event fires.|66|Yes|  
|HostName|**nvarchar**|Name of the computer on which the client is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the host name. To determine the host name, use the HOST_NAME function.|8|Yes|  
|IsSystem|**int**|Indicates whether the event occurred on a system process or a user process. 1 = system, 0 = user.|60|Yes|  
|LinkedServerName|**nvarchar**|Name of the linked server.|45|Yes|  
|LoginName|**nvarchar**|Name of the login of the user (either [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security login or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows login credentials in the form of DOMAIN\Username).|11|Yes|  
|LoginSid|**image**|Security identifier (SID) of the logged-in user. You can find this information in the sys.server_principals catalog view. Each SID is unique for each login in the server.|41|Yes|  
|MethodName|**nvarchar**|Name of the calling method.|47|No|  
|NTDomainName|**nvarchar**|Windows domain to which the user belongs.|7|Yes|  
|NTUserName|**nvarchar**|Windows user name.|6|Yes|  
|ProviderName|**nvarchar**|Name of the OLE DB provider.|46|Yes|  
|RequestID|**int**|ID of the request containing the statement.|49|Yes|  
|SessionLoginName|**nvarchar**|Login name of the user who originated the session. For example, if you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using Login1 and execute a statement as Login2, SessionLoginName shows Login1 and LoginName shows Login2. This column displays both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows logins.|64|Yes|  
|SPID|**Int**|ID of the session on which the event occurred.|12|Yes|  
|StartTime|**datetime**|Time at which the event started, if available.|14|Yes|  
|TextData|**nvarchar**|Parameters sent and received in the OLE DB call.|1|No|  
|TransactionID|**bigint**|System-assigned ID of the transaction.|4|Yes|
