# Data Source Selection Page (Report Manager)
  Use the Data Source Selection page to select an existing shared data source item to use with a report or a report model. You can also use this page to select a different data source. To view the data source type or connection string, you must navigate to the shared data source and open the property pages.  
  
## Navigation  
 Use the following procedure to navigate to this location in the user interface (UI).  
  
###### To open the Data Source Selection page  
  
1.  Open Report Manager, and locate the report or model for which you want to select a data source.  
  
2.  Hover over the report, and click the drop-down arrow.  
  
3.  In the drop-down menu, click **Manage**. This opens the General properties page for the report or model.  
  
4.  Select the **Data Sources** tab.  
  
5.  In the properties pane, select **A shared data source** and then click **Browse**.  
  
## Options  
 **Location**  
 Specify the full path to the shared data source item, beginning with the root folder name. You can type the path name or use the tree view to navigate to the shared data source you want.  
  
 **Tree view**  
 Shows the folder structure of the report server namespace. Click a shared data source item to add the full path to the **Location** field.  
  
 **OK**  
 Click to copy the data source selection to the Data Sources properties page.
