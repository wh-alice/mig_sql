# Options (Text Editor/File Extension Page)
  Use the **Options** dialog box to specify how all files with certain file extensions are handled by [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull_md](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. For each extension that you enter, you can select an editor. Thus, you can choose the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull_md](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]editor in which documents of a certain type will open. To open the file extension options, click **Options** on the **Tools** menu, expand **Text Editor**, and then click **File Extension**.  
  
 When you select, from the **Editor** drop-down list, an option "with Encoding", a dialog box appears whenever you open a document of that type that allows you to select an encoding scheme for that document. This can be helpful if you are preparing versions of your scripts for use on a different operating system or in different target languages.  
  
## Options  
 **Extension**  
 Type a file extension.  
  
 **Editor**  
 Select the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull_md](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] editor that you want to use to open documents with the file extension you entered in the **Extension** box. When you select an option "with Encoding," a dialog box appears whenever you open such a document that allows you to select an encoding scheme.  
  
 **Add**  
 Add an entry that includes the specified **Extension** and **Editing experience** values to **ExtensionList**.  
  
 **Remove**  
 Delete the selected entry from **Extension List**.  
  
 **Extension**  
 Lists all extensions for which an editor has been specified.  
  
 **Editing Experience**  
 Lists the editors selected for **Extensions**.  
  
 **Map extensionless files to**  
 Specify how files without extensions are to be handled by [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull_md](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 Extensionless file editor  
 This drop-down list at the bottom of the page provides the same list as the **Editing Experience** option. Select the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull_md](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] editor or designer in which documents without file extensions will open.
