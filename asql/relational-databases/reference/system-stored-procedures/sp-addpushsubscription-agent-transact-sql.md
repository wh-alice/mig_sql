# sp_addpushsubscription_agent (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Adds a new scheduled agent job used to synchronize a push subscription to a transactional publication. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When configuring a Publisher with a remote Distributor, the values supplied for all parameters, including *job_login* and *job_password*, are sent to the Distributor as plain text. You should encrypt the connection between the Publisher and its remote Distributor before executing this stored procedure. For more information, see [Enable Encrypted Connections to the Database Engine &#40;SQL Server Configuration Manager&#41;](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/enable-encrypted-connections-to-the-database-engine.md).

 [ **@subscriber_db =**] **'***subscriber_db***'**  
 Is the name of the subscription database. *subscriber_db* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL. For a non-SQL Server Subscriber, specify a value of **(default destination)** for *subscriber_db*.  
  
 [ **@subscriber_security_mode =**] *subscriber_security_mode*

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  For queued updating subscriptions, use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication for connections to Subscribers, and specify a different account for the connection to each Subscriber. For all other subscriptions, use Windows Authentication.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Do not use a blank password. Use a strong password. When possible, prompt users to enter security credentials at runtime. If you must store credentials in a script file, you must secure the file to prevent unauthorized access.  
  
 [ **@job_login =** ] **'***job_login***'**  
 Is the login for the Windows account under which the agent runs. *job_login* is **nvarchar(257)**, with a default value of NULL. This Windows account is always used for agent connections to the Distributor and for connections to the Subscriber when using Windows Integrated authentication.
