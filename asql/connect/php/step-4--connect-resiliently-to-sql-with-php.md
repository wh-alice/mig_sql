# Step 4: Connect resiliently to SQL with PHP

The demo program is designed so that a transient error during an attempt to connect leads to a retry. But a transient error during query command causes the program to discard the connection and create a new connection, before retrying the query command. We neither recommend nor disrecommend this design choice. The demo program illustrates some of the design flexibility that is available to you.  
  
The length of this code sample is due mostly to the catch exception logic.   
  
The Main method is in Program.cs. The callstack runs as follows:  
* Main calls ConnectAndQuery.  
* ConnectAndQuery calls EstablishConnection.  
* EstablishConnection calls IssueQueryCommand.  
  
The [sqlsrv_query()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.sqlsrv-query.php) function can be used to retrieve a result set from a query against SQL Database. This function essentially accepts any query and the connection object and returns a result set which can be iterated over with the use of [sqlsrv_fetch_array()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.sqlsrv-fetch-array.php).  
  
```php

    <?php  
        // Variables to tune the retry logic.    
        $connectionTimeoutSeconds = 30;  // Default of 15 seconds is too short over the Internet, sometimes.  
        $maxCountTriesConnectAndQuery = 3;  // You can adjust the various retry count values.  
        $secondsBetweenRetries = 4;  // Simple retry strategy.  
        $errNo = 0;  
        $serverName = "tcp:yourdatabase.database.windows.net,1433";  
        $connectionOptions = array("Database"=>"AdventureWorks",  
           "Uid"=>"yourusername", "PWD"=>"yourpassword", "LoginTimeout" => $connectionTimeoutSeconds);  
        $conn;  
        $errorArr = array();  
        for ($cc = 1; $cc <= $maxCountTriesConnectAndQuery; $cc++)  
        {  
            $errorArr = array();  
            $ctr = 0;  
            // [A.2] Connect, which proceeds to issue a query command.  
            $conn = sqlsrv_connect($serverName, $connectionOptions);    
            if( $conn == true)  
            {  
                echo "Connection was established";  
                echo "<br>";  
  
                $tsql = "SELECT [CompanyName] FROM SalesLT.Customer";  
                $getProducts = sqlsrv_query($conn, $tsql);  
                if ($getProducts == FALSE)  
                    die(FormatErrors(sqlsrv_errors()));  
                $productCount = 0;  
                $ctr = 0;  
                while($row = sqlsrv_fetch_array($getProducts, SQLSRV_FETCH_ASSOC))  
                {     
                    $ctr++;  
                    echo($row['CompanyName']);  
                    echo("<br/>");
