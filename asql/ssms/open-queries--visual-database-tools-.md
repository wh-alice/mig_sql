# Open Queries (Visual Database Tools)
You can open an existing query in Query and View Designer by using the **Open** command.  
  
### To open a query in all panes  
  
1.  From the **View** menu, click **Solution Explorer**.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the query you want to open and click **Open**.  
  
3.  To modify the query in Query Designer, highlight the SQL statements, right-click the highlighted area and select **Design Query in Editor.**  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> By default the Query and View Designer opens all of its panes (SQL, Criteria, Diagram, and Results), but that default can be changed in the **Options** dialog box. To open these panes if they are closed, from the **Query Designer** menu, point to **Pane**, and then click the pane you want to open.
