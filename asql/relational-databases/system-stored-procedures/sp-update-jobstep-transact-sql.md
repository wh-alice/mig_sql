 The name of the database in which to execute a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] step. *database*is **sysname**. Names that are enclosed in brackets ([ ]) are not allowed. The default value is NULL.  
  
 [ **@database_user_name =**] **'***user***'**  
 The name of the user account to use when executing a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] step. *user*is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.

|**16**|Write log to table (append to existing history)|  
  
 [ **@proxy_id**= ] *proxy_id*  
 The ID number of the proxy that the job step runs as. *proxy_id* is type **int**, with a default of NULL. If no *proxy_id* is specified, no *proxy_name* is specified, and no *user_name* is specified, the job step runs as the service account for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent.  
  
 [ **@proxy_name**= ] **'***proxy_name***'**  
 The name of the proxy that the job step runs as. *proxy_name* is type **sysname**, with a default of NULL. If no *proxy_id* is specified, no *proxy_name* is specified, and no *user_name* is specified, the job step runs as the service account for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_update_jobstep** must be run from the **msdb** database.  
  
 Updating a job step increments the job version number.  
  
## Permissions  
 By default, members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can execute this stored procedure. Other users must be granted one of the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent fixed database roles in the **msdb** database:  
  
-   **SQLAgentUserRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentReaderRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentOperatorRole**  
  
 For details about the permissions of these roles, see [SQL Server Agent Fixed Database Roles](../Topic/SQL%20Server%20Agent%20Fixed%20Database%20Roles.md).  
  
 Only members of **sysadmin** can update a job step owned by another user.  
  
 If the job step requires access to a proxy, the creator of the job step must have access to the proxy for the job step. All subsystems, except Transact-SQL, require a proxy account. Members of **sysadmin** have access to all proxies, and can use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service account for the proxy.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example changes the number of retry attempts for the first step of the `Weekly Sales Data Backup` job. After running this example, the number of retry attempts is `10`.  
  
```  
USE msdb ;  
GO  
  
EXEC dbo.sp_update_jobstep  
    @job_name = N'Weekly Sales Data Backup',  
    @step_id = 1,  
    @retry_attempts = 10 ;  
GO  
```
