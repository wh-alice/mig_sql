    ```  
    USE AdventureWorks2012;  
    GO  
    -- First, create two statistics named VendorCredit and CustomerTotal  
    -- The first statistic uses a random 50% sample of information provided from the Name and CreditRating columns in the Purchasing.Vendor table.  
    CREATE STATISTICS VendorCredit  
        ON Purchasing.Vendor (Name, CreditRating)  
        WITH SAMPLE 50 PERCENT  
    -- The second statistic uses all of the information from the CustomerID and TotalDue columns in the Sales.SalesOrderHeader table  
    CREATE STATISTICS CustomerTotal  
        ON Sales.SalesOrderHeader (CustomerID, TotalDue)  
        WITH FULLSCAN;  
    GO  
    -- This next statement drops both of the statistics created above. Note that the naming convention is [table_name].[statistics_name].  
    DROP STATISTICS Purchasing.Vendor.VendorCredit, Sales.SalesOrderHeader.CustomerTotal;  
    GO  
    ```
