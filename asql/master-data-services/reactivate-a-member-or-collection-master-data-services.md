# Reactivate a Member or Collection (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], you can reactivate a member that was either:  
  
-   Deactivated by the staging process.  
  
-   Deleted in the MDS [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)].  
  
-   Deleted in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] web application.  
  
 When you reactivate a member, its attributes and its membership in hierarchies and collections are restored.  
  
 You can also reactivate collections. When you do, the collectionâ€™s attributes and the members that belong to the collection are restored.  
  
 When either a collection or member is reactivated, all previous transactions are restored.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], you must have permission to the **Version Management** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To reactivate a member or collection  
  
1.  On the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] home page, click **Version Management**.  
  
2.  On the menu bar, click **Transactions**.  
  
3.  On the **Transactions** page, from the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
4.  From the **Version** list, select a version.  
  
5.  In the **Transactions** pane, click the row for the member or collection you want to reactivate. This row should have **Active** displayed in the **Prior Value** column and **De-Activated** in the **New Value** column.  
  
6.  Click **Reverse Transaction**.  
  
7.  On the confirmation dialog box, click **OK**. A new transaction is added, showing **Active** in the **New Value** column.
