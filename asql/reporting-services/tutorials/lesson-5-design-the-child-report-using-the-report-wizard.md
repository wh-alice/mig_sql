# Lesson 5: Design the Child Report using the Report Wizard
After you create a data connection and data table for the child report, your next step is to design the child report using the Report Wizard in Report Designer. For more information about Report Designer, see [Design Reports with Report Designer &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/tools/design-reporting-services-paginated-reports-with-report-designer-ssrs.md).  
  
### To design the child report using the Report Wizard  
  
1.  Make sure that the top-level website is selected in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
2.  Right-click on the website and select **Add New Item**.  
  
3.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, click **Report Wizard**, enter a name for the report file, and then select **Add**.  
  
    This launches the Report Wizard.  
  
4.  In the **Dataset Properties** page, in the **Data source** box, select **DataSet2**.  
  
    The **Available datasets** box is automatically updated with the DataTable you created.  
  
5.  Select **Next**.  
  
6.  In the **Arrange Fields** page do the following:  
  
    1.  Drag **ProductID**, **PurchaseOrderID**, **PurchaseOrderDetailID**, **OrderQty**, **ReceivedQty**, **RejectedQty**, and **StockedQty** from **Available Fields** to the **Values** box.  
  
    2.  Select the arrow next to **Sum(ProductID)**, **Sum(PurchaseOrderID)**, **Sum(PurchaseOrderDetailID)**, **Sum(OrderQty)**, **Sum(ReceivedQty)**, **Sum(RejectedQty)**, and **Sum(StockedQty)** and clear the **Sum** selection.  
  
7.  Select **Next** twice, then Select **Finish** to close the **Report Wizard**.  
  
    Youâ€™ve now created the .rdlc file. The file opens in Report Designer. The tablix you designed is now displayed in the design surface.  
  
8.  With the .rdlc file open, add a parameter by doing the following:  
  
    1.  Right-click **Parameters** in the **Report Data** pane, and then select **Add Parameters**.  
  
    2.  Enter **productid** in the **Name** box.  
  
    3.  Confirm that **Integer** is selected in the **Data Type** list box.  
  
    4.  Click **OK**.  
  
9. Save the .rdlc file.  
  
## Next Task  
You have successfully designed the child report by using the Report Wizard. Next, you will add a ReportViewer control to the website application. See [Lesson 6: Add a ReportViewer Control to the Application](../../reporting-services/tutorials/lesson-6-add-a-reportviewer-control-to-the-application.md).
