# Tabular Model Projects (SSAS Tabular)
  To create a new tabular model, you must first create a new tabular model project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. When you install [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)], three new Business Intelligence project templates are provided for creating tabular model projects. Each project template provides a framework on which you can begin authoring your model. Topics in this section describe how to create a new tabular model project by using the project templates.
