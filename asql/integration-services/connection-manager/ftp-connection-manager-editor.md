# FTP Connection Manager Editor
  Use the **FTP Connection Manager Editor** dialog box to specify properties for connecting to an FTP server.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The FTP connection manager supports only anonymous authentication and basic authentication. It does not support Windows Authentication.  
  
 To learn more about the FTP connection manager, see [FTP Connection Manager](../../integration-services/connection-manager/ftp-connection-manager.md).
