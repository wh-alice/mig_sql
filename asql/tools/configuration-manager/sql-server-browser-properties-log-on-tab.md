# SQL Server Browser Properties (Log On Tab)
  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser program runs as a service on the server. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser listens for incoming requests for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resources and provides information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instances installed on the computer.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser listens on a UDP port and accepts unauthenticated requests using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Resolution Protocol (SSRP).  
  
 Changing the password of an account takes effect immediately without restarting the service.  
  
## Options  
 **Local System account**  
 Run the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service in the security context of the Local System account. When possible, use a low-permission account instead.  
  
 **This account**  
 Specify a local or domain user account that uses Windows Authentication. We recommend using a domain user account with minimal rights for services. For information about selecting an account, see "Setting Up Windows Service Accounts" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.  
  
 **Browse**  
 Browse for a user or built-in security principal.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Use a low-permission account. For information about the permissions required for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser Service, see the Security section of [SQL Server Browser Service](../../tools/configuration-manager/sql-server-browser-service.md).  
  
 **Password**  
 Enter the password of the security principal.  
  
 **Confirm password**  
 Confirm the password of the security principal.  
  
 **Service status**  
 Indicates whether this service is running, stopped, or disabled. "**â€¦**" indicates a state change is pending.  
  
 **Start**  
 Start the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service.  
  
 **Stop**  
 Stop the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service.  
  
 **Pause**  
 Pause the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service.  
  
 **Resume**
