# SMO Programming - Getting Started in Visual C# .NET
  [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../a9retired/includes/csprcs-md.md)] .NET is one of the managed programming languages that are supported by the common language runtime (CLR) in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../a9retired/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] .NET. Many For more information about the C# language, see the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../a9retired/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] .NET documentation. You can use [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/includes/vsprvslong-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vsOrcas](../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/includes/vsorcas-md.md)] to develop SMO applications.  
  
## References and Imports  
 After you have started the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../a9retired/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] project, you must add references to the SMO assemblies. You then import the required namespaces so that your program can recognize the SMO types.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)], the SMO assemblies are located in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\SDK\Assemblies\ folder.
