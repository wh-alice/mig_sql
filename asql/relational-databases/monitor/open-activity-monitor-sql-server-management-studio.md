# Open Activity Monitor (SQL Server Management Studio)

   
 Activity Monitor runs queries on the monitored instance to obtain information for the Activity Monitor display panes. When the refresh interval is set to less than 10 seconds, the time that is used to run these queries can affect server performance  
  
  
##  <a name="Permissions"></a> Check your permissions!  
 To view actual activity, you must have VIEW SERVER STATE permission. To view the Data File I/O section of Activity Monitor, you must have CREATE DATABASE, ALTER ANY DATABASE, or VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission in addition to VIEW SERVER STATE.  
  
 To KILL a process, a user must be a member of the sysadmin or processadmin fixed server roles.
