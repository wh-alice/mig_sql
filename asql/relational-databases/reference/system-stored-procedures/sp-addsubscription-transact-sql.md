## Arguments  
 [ @publication=] '*publication*'  
 Is the name of the publication. *publication* is **sysname**, with no default.  
  
 [ @article=] '*article*'  
 Is the article to which the publication is subscribed. *article* is **sysname**, with a default of all. If all, a subscription is added to all articles in that publication. Only values of all or NULL are supported for Oracle Publishers.  
  
 [ @subscriber=] '*subscriber*'  
 Is the name of the Subscriber. *subscriber* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ @destination_db=] '*destination_db*'  
 Is the name of the destination database in which to place replicated data. *destination_db* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL. When NULL, *destination_db* is set to the name of the publication database. For Oracle Publishers, *destination_db* must be specified. For a non-SQL Server Subscriber, specify a value of (default destination) for *destination_db*.  
  
 [ @sync_type=] '*sync_type*'  
 Is the subscription synchronization type. *sync_type* is **nvarchar(255)**, and can be one of the following values:  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|none|Subscriber already has the schema and initial data for published tables.<br /><br /> Note: This option has been deprecated. Use replication support only instead.|  
|automatic (default)|Schema and initial data for published tables are transferred to the Subscriber first.|  
|replication support only|Provides automatic generation at the Subscriber of article custom stored procedures and triggers that support updating subscriptions, if appropriate. Assumes that the Subscriber already has the schema and initial data for published tables. When configuring a peer-to-peer transactional replication topology, ensure that the data at all nodes in the topology is identical. For more information, see [Peer-to-Peer Transactional Replication](../../../relational-databases/replication/transactional/peer-to-peer-transactional-replication.md).<br /><br /> *Not supported for subscriptions to non-SQL Server publications.*|  
|initialize with backup|Schema and initial data for published tables are obtained from a backup of the publication database. Assumes that the Subscriber has access to a backup of the publication database. The location of the backup and media type for the backup are specified by *backupdevicename* and *backupdevicetype*. When using this option, a peer-to-peer transactional replication topology need not be quiesced during configuration.<br /><br /> *Not supported for subscriptions to non-SQL Server publications.*|  
|initialize from lsn|Used when you are adding a node to a peer-to-peer transactional replication topology. Used with @subscriptionlsn to make sure that all relevant transactions are replicated to the new node. Assumes that the Subscriber already has the schema and initial data for published tables. For more information, see [Peer-to-Peer Transactional Replication](../../../relational-databases/replication/transactional/peer-to-peer-transactional-replication.md).|  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  System tables and data are always transferred.  
  
 [ @status=] '*status*'

|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|active|Subscription is initialized and ready to accept changes. This option is set when the value of *sync_type* is none, initialize with backup, or replication support only.|  
|subscribed|Subscription needs to be initialized. This option is set when the value of *sync_type* is automatic.|  
  
 [ @subscription_type=] '*subscription_type*'  
 Is the type of subscription. *subscription_type* is **nvarchar(4)**, with a default of push. Can be push or pull. The Distribution Agents of push subscriptions reside at the Distributor, and the Distribution Agents of pull subscriptions reside at the Subscriber. *subscription_type* can be pull to create a named pull subscription that is known to the Publisher. For more information, see [Subscribe to Publications](../../../relational-databases/replication/subscribe-to-publications.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Anonymous subscriptions do not need to use this stored procedure.  
  
 [ @update_mode=] '*update_mode*'  
 Is the type of update.*update_mode* is **nvarchar(30)**, and can be one of these values.  
  
|Value|Description|

|read only (default)|The subscription is read-only. The changes at the Subscriber are not sent to the Publisher.|  
|sync tran|Enables support for immediate updating subscriptions. Not supported for Oracle Publishers.|  
|queued tran|Enables the subscription for queued updating. Data modifications can be made at the Subscriber, stored in a queue, and then propagated to the Publisher. Not supported for Oracle Publishers.|  
|failover|Enables the subscription for immediate updating with queued updating as a failover. Data modifications can be made at the Subscriber and propagated to the Publisher immediately. If the Publisher and Subscriber are not connected, the updating mode can be changed so that data modifications made at the Subscriber are stored in a queue until the Subscriber and Publisher are reconnected. Not supported for Oracle Publishers.|  
|queued failover|Enables the subscription as a queued updating subscription with the ability to change to immediate updating mode. Data modifications can be made at the Subscriber and stored in a queue until a connection is established between the Subscriber and Publisher. When a continuous connection is established the updating mode can be changed to immediate updating. Not supported for Oracle Publishers.|  
  
 Note that the values synctran and queued tran are not allowed if the publication being subscribed to allows DTS.

## Return Code Values  
 0 (success) or 1 (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 sp_addsubscription is used in snapshot replication and transactional replication.  
  
 When sp_addsubscription is executed by a member of the sysadmin fixed server role to create a push subscription, the Distribution Agent job is implicitly created and runs under the SQL Server Agent service account. We recommend that you execute [sp_addpushsubscription_agent](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addpushsubscription-agent-transact-sql.md) and specify the credentials of a different, agent-specific Windows account for @job_login and @job_password. For more information, see [Replication Agent Security Model](../../../relational-databases/replication/security/replication-agent-security-model.md).  
  
 sp_addsubscription prevents ODBC and OLE DB Subscribers access to publications that:  
  
-   Were created with the native *sync_method* in the call to [sp_addpublication](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addpublication-transact-sql.md).  
  
-   Contain articles that were added to the publication with the [sp_addarticle](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addarticle-transact-sql.md) stored procedure that had a *pre_creation_cmd* parameter value of 3 (truncate).  
  
-   Attempt to set *update_mode* to sync tran.  
  
-   Have an article configured to use parameterized statements.  
  
 In addition, if a publication has the *allow_queued_tran* option set to true (which enables queuing of changes at the Subscriber until they can be applied at the Publisher), the timestamp column in an article is scripted out as **timestamp**, and changes on that column are sent to the Subscriber. The Subscriber generates and updates the timestamp column value. For an ODBC or OLE DB Subscriber, sp_addsubscription fails if an attempt is made to subscribe to a publication that has *allow_queued_tran* set to true and articles with timestamp columns in it.  
  
 If a subscription does not use a DTS package, it cannot subscribe to a publication that is set to *allow_transformable_subscriptions*. If the table from the publication needs to be replicated to both a DTS subscription and non-DTS subscription, two separate publications have to be created: one for each type of subscription.  
  
 When selecting the **sync_type** options *replication support only*, *initialize with backup*, or *initialize from lsn*, the log reader agent must run after executing **sp_addsubscription**, so that the set-up scripts are written to the distribution database. The log reader agent must be running under an account that is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role. When the **sync_type** option is set to *Automatic*, no special log reader agent actions are required.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the sysadmin fixed server role or db_owner fixed database role can execute sp_addsubscription. For pull subscriptions, users with logins in the publication access list can execute sp_addsubscription.
