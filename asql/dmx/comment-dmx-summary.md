  Indicates a text string that [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] should not execute. You can nest comments within a Data Mining Extensions (DMX) statement, include them at the end of a line of code, or insert them on a separate line.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
-- Comment_Text      
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *Comment_Text*  
 The string that contains the text of the comment.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use this operator for single-line or nested comments. Comments that are inserted by using -- are delimited by the newline character.  
  
 There is no maximum length for comments.  
  
 For more information about how to use different kinds of comments in DMX, see [Comments &#40;DMX&#41;](../dmx/comments-dmx.md).
