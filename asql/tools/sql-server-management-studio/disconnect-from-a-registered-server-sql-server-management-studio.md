  This topic describes how to  disconnect Object Explorer from a server at any time in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. Disconnecting Object Explorer does not disconnect other [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] components such as SQL Editor.
