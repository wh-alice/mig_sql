[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Denies permissions on a [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] contract, message type, remote service binding, route, or service.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
DENY permission  [ ,...n ] ON  
    {    
       [ CONTRACT :: contract_name ]   
       | [ MESSAGE TYPE :: message_type_name ]    
       | [ REMOTE SERVICE BINDING :: remote_binding_name ]    
       | [ ROUTE :: route_name ]   
       | [ SERVICE :: service_name ]      
        }  
    TO database_principal [ ,...n ]   
    [ CASCADE ]  
        [ AS denying_principal ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be denied on a [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] securable. For a list of the permissions, see the Remarks section later in this topic.  
  
 CONTRACT **::***contract_name*  
 Specifies the contract on which the permission is being denied. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 MESSAGE TYPE **::***message_type_name*  
 Specifies the message type on which the permission is being denied. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 REMOTE SERVICE BINDING **::***remote_binding_name*  
 Specifies the remote service binding on which the permission is being denied. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 ROUTE **::***route_name*  
 Specifies the route on which the permission is being denied. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 SERVICE **::***message_type_name*  
 Specifies the service on which the permission is being denied. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is being denied. One of the following:  
  
-   Database user  
  
-   Database role  
  
-   Application role  
  
-   Database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   Database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   Database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   Database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   Database user not mapped to a server principal  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being denied is also denied to other principals to which it has been granted by this principal.  
  
 *denying_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to deny the permission. One of the following:  
  
-   Database user  
  
-   Database role  
  
-   Application role  
  
-   Database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   Database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   Database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   Database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   Database user not mapped to a server principal  
  
## Remarks  
  
## Service Broker Contracts  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] contract is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on a [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] contract are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Service Broker contract permission|Implied by Service Broker contract permission|Implied by database permission|  
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY CONTRACT|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Service Broker Message Types  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] message type is a database-level securable that is contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on a [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] message type are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Service Broker message type permission|Implied by Service Broker message type permission|Implied by database permission|

## Service Broker Remote Service Bindings  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] remote service binding is a database-level securable that is contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on a [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] remote service binding are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Service Broker remote service binding permission|Implied by Service Broker remote service binding permission|Implied by database permission|

|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Service Broker Routes  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] route is a database-level securable that is contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on a [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] route are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.

### Service Broker Services  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] service is a database-level securable that is contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on a [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] service are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.

## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] contract, message type, remote service binding, route, or service. If the AS clause is used, the specified principal must own the securable on which permissions are being denied.
