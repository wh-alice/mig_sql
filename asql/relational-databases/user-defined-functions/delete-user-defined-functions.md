# Delete User-defined Functions
  You can delete (drop) user-defined functions in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)]

     [Limitations and Restrictions](#Restrictions)  
  
     [Security](#Security)  
  
-   **To delete a user-defined function, using:**  
  
     [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMSProcedure)  
  
     [Transact-SQL](#TsqlProcedure)  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   You will not be able to delete the function if there are Transact-SQL functions or views in the database that reference this function and were created by using SCHEMABINDING, or if there are computed columns, CHECK constraints, or DEFAULT constraints that reference the function.  
  
-   You will not be able to delete the function if there are computed columns that reference this function and have been indexed.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Requires ALTER permission on the schema to which the function belongs, or CONTROL permission on the function.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To delete a user-defined function  
  
1.  Click on the plus sign next to the database that contains the function you wish to modify.  
  
2.  Click on the plus sign next to the **Programmability** folder.  
  
3.  Click the plus sign next to the folder that contains the function you wish to modify:  
  
    -   Table-valued Function  
  
    -   Scalar-valued Function  
  
    -   Aggregate Function  
  
4.  Right-click the function you want to delete and select **Delete**.  
  
5.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, click **OK**.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Click **Show Dependencies** in the **Delete Object** dialog box to open the *function_name***Dependencies** dialog box. This will show all of the objects that depend on the function and all of the objects on which the function depends.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To delete a user-defined function  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- creates function called “Sales.ufn_SalesByStore”  
    USE AdventureWorks2012;  
    GO  
    CREATE FUNCTION Sales.ufn_SalesByStore (@storeid int)  
    RETURNS TABLE  
    AS  
    RETURN   
    (  
        SELECT P.ProductID, P.Name, SUM(SD.LineTotal) AS 'Total'  
        FROM Production.Product AS P   
        JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS SD ON SD.ProductID = P.ProductID  
        JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SH ON SH.SalesOrderID = SD.SalesOrderID  
        JOIN Sales.Customer AS C ON SH.CustomerID = C.CustomerID  
        WHERE C.StoreID = @storeid  
        GROUP BY P.ProductID, P.Name  
    );  
    GO  
    ```  
  
    ```  
    USE AdventureWorks2012;  
    GO  
    -- determines if function exists in database  
    IF OBJECT_ID (N'Sales.fn_SalesByStore', N'IF') IS NOT NULL  
    -- deletes function  
        DROP FUNCTION Sales.fn_SalesByStore;  
    GO  
    ```
