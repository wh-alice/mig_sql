# Integration Services Roles (SSIS Service)
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] provides certain fixed database-level roles to help secure access to packages that are stored in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The available roles are different depending on whether you're saving packages in the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB) or in the msdb database.  
  
## Roles in the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB)  
 The SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB) provides the following fixed database-level roles to help secure access to packages and information about packages.  
  
-   **ssis_admin**. This role provides full administrative access to the SSIS Catalog database.  
  
-   **ssis_logreader** This role provides permissions to access all the views related SSISDB operational logs.  
  
     The list of views includes: [catalog].[projects], [catalog].[packages], [catalog].[operations], [catalog].[extended_operation_info], [catalog].[operation_messages], [catalog].[event_messages], [catalog].[execution_data_statistics], [catalog].[execution_component_phases], [catalog].[execution_data_taps], [catalog].[event_message_context], [catalog].[executions], [catalog].[executables], [catalog].[executable_statistics], [catalog].[validations], [catalog].[execution_parameter_values], and [catalog].[execution_property_override_values].  
  
## Roles in the msdb database  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] includes the three fixed database-level roles, **db_ssisadmin**, **db_ssisltduser**, and **db_ssisoperator**, for controlling access to packages that are saved to the **msdb** database. You assign roles to a package using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. The role assignments are saved to the **msdb** database.  
  
### Read and Write Actions  
 The following table describes the read and write actions of Windows and fixed database-level roles in [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].  
  
|Role|Read action|Write action|  
|----------|-----------------|------------------|  
|**db_ssisadmin**<br /><br /> or<br /><br /> **sysadmin**|Enumerate own packages.<br /><br /> Enumerate all packages.<br /><br /> View own packages.<br /><br /> View all packages.<br /><br /> Execute own packages.<br /><br /> Execute all packages.<br /><br /> Export own packages.<br /><br /> Export all packages.<br /><br /> Execute all packages in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent.|Import packages.<br /><br /> Delete own packages.<br /><br /> Delete all packages.<br /><br /> Change own package roles.<br /><br /> Change all package roles.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> **\*\* Warning \*\***Members of the db_ssisadmin role and the dc_admin role may be able to elevate their privileges to sysadmin. This elevation of privilege can occur because these roles can modify [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages and [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages can be executed by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using the sysadmin security context of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent. To guard against this elevation of privilege when running maintenance plans, data collection sets, and other [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages, configure [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs that run packages to use a proxy account with limited privileges or only add sysadmin members to the db_ssisadmin and dc_admin roles.|  
|**db_ssisltduser**|Enumerate own packages.<br /><br /> Enumerate all packages.<br /><br /> View own packages.<br /><br /> Execute own packages.<br /><br /> Export own packages.|Import packages.<br /><br /> Delete own packages.<br /><br /> Change own package roles.|  
|**db_ssisoperator**|Enumerate all packages.<br /><br /> View all packages.<br /><br /> Execute all packages.<br /><br /> Export all packages.<br /><br /> Execute all packages in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent.|None|  
|**Windows administrators**|View execution details of all running packages.|Stop all currently running packages.|  
  
### Sysssispackages Table  
 The **sysssispackages** table in **msdb** contains the packages that are saved to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see [sysssispackages &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/reference/system-tables/sysssispackages-transact-sql.md).  
  
 The **sysssispackages** table includes columns that contain information about the roles that are assigned to packages.  
  
-   The **readerrole** column specifies the role that has read access to the package.  
  
-   The **writerrole** column specifies the role that has write access to the package.  
  
-   The **ownersid** column contains the unique security identifier of the user who created the package. This column defines the owner of the package.  
  
### Permissions  
 By default, the permissions of the **db_ssisadmin** and **db_ssisoperator** fixed database-level roles and the unique security identifier of the user who created the package apply to the reader role for packages, and the permissions of the **db_ssisadmin** role and the unique security identifier of the user who created the package apply to the writer role. A user must be a member of the **db_ssisadmin**, **db_ssisltduser**, or **db_ssisoperator** role to have read access to the package. A user must be a member of the **db_ssisadmin** role to have write access.  
  
### Access to Packages  
 The fixed database-level roles work in conjunction with user-defined roles. The user-defined roles are the roles that you create in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and then use to assign permissions to packages. To access a package, a user must be a member of the user-defined role and the pertinent [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] fixed database-level role. For example, if users are members of the **AuditUsers** user-defined role that is assigned to a package, they must also be members of **db_ssisadmin**, **db_ssisltduser**, or **db_ssisoperator** role to have read access to the package.  
  
 If you do not assign user-defined roles to packages, access to packages is determined by the fixed database-level roles.  
  
 If you want to use user-defined roles, you must add them to the **msdb** database before you can assign them to packages. You can create new database roles in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] database-level roles grant rights on the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] system tables in the msdb database.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (the MSSQLSERVER service) must be started before you can connect to the Database Engine and access the **msdb** database.  
  
 To assign roles to packages, you need to complete the following tasks.  
  
-   **Open Object Explorer and Connect to Integration Services**  
  
     Before you can assign roles to packages by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], you must open Object Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and connect to [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].  
  
     The [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service must be started before you can connect to [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   **Assign Reader and Writer Roles to Packages**  
  
     You can assign a reader and a writer role to each package.
