# Common Actions Requiring an Updated Backup
  If you perform regular log backups, any replication-related changes should be captured in the log backups. If you don't perform log backups, perform a backup of the publication, distribution, subscription, **msdb**, and **master** databases after making modifications to your replication schema or topology.  
  
## Publication Database  
 Backup the publication database after:  
  
-   Creating new publications.  
  
-   Changing any publication property, including filtering.  
  
-   Adding articles to an existing publication.  
  
-   Performing a publication-wide reinitialization of subscriptions.  
  
-   Making a schema change on a published table.  
  
-   Performing on-demand script execution with [sp_addscriptexec &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addscriptexec-transact-sql.md).  
  
-   Changing any article property.  
  
-   Dropping any publications.  
  
-   Dropping any articles.  
  
-   Disabling replication.  
  
## Distribution Database  
 Backup the distribution database after:  
  
-   Creating or modifying replication agent profiles.  
  
-   Modifying replication agent profile parameters.  
  
-   Changing the replication agent properties (including schedules) for any push subscriptions.  
  
-   A new range of identities is assigned by the automatic identity range management feature.  
  
## Subscription Database  
 Backup the subscription database after:  
  
-   Changing any subscription property.  
  
-   Changing the priority for a merge subscription at the Publisher.  
  
-   Dropping any subscriptions.  
  
-   Disabling replication.  
  
## msdb Database  
 Backup the **msdb** system database at the appropriate node after:  
  
-   Enabling or disabling replication.  
  
-   Adding or dropping a distribution database (at the Distributor).  
  
-   Enabling or disabling a database for publishing (at the Publisher).  
  
-   Creating or modifying replication agent profiles (at the Distributor).  
  
-   Modifying any replication agent profile parameters (at the Distributor).  
  
-   Changing the replication agent properties (including schedules) for any push subscriptions (at the Distributor).  
  
-   Changing the replication agent properties (including schedules) for any pull subscriptions (at the Subscriber).  
  
-   Creating a DTS package associated with a transactional publication that uses transformable subscriptions (at the Distributor and Subscriber).  
  
-   Adding or dropping a transformable subscription (at the Distributor and Subscriber).  
  
## master Database  
 Backup the **master** system database at the appropriate node after:  
  
-   Enabling or disabling replication.  
  
-   Adding or dropping a distribution database (at the Distributor).  
  
-   Enabling or disabling a database for publishing (at the Publisher).  
  
-   Adding the first or dropping the last publication in any database (at the Publisher).  
  
-   Adding the first or dropping the last subscription in any database (at the Subscriber).  
  
-   Enabling or disabling a Publisher at a Distribution Publisher (at the Publisher and Distributor).
