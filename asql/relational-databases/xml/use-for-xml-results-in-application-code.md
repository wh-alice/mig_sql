# Use FOR XML Results in Application Code
  By using FOR XML clauses with SQL queries, you can retrieve and even cast query results as XML data. This functionality allows you to do the following when FOR XML query results can be used in XML application code:  
  
-   Query SQL tables for instances of [XML Data &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/xml/xml-data-sql-server.md) values  
  
-   Apply the [TYPE Directive in FOR XML Queries](../../relational-databases/xml/type-directive-in-for-xml-queries.md) to return the result of queries that contain text or image typed data as XML  
  
 This topic provides examples that demonstrate these approaches.  
  
## Retrieving FOR XML Data with ADO and XML Data Islands  
 The ADO **Stream** object or other objects that support the COM **IStream** interface, such as the Active Server Pages (ASP) **Request** and **Response** objects, can be used to contain the results when you are working with FOR XML queries.  
  
 For example, the following ASP code shows the results of querying an **xml** data type column, Demographics, in the Sales.Store table of the AdventureWorks sample database. Specifically, the query looks for the instance value of this column for the row where the CustomerID is equal to 3.  
  
```

   Dim xmlDoc  
   Set xmlDoc = MyDataIsle.XMLDocument  
   Dim root  
   Set root = xmlDoc.documentElement.childNodes.Item(0).childNodes.Item(0).childNodes.Item(0)  
   For each child in root.childNodes  
      dim OutputXML  
      OutputXML = document.all("log").innerHTML  
      document.all("log").innerHTML = OutputXML & "<LI><B>" & child.nodeName &  ":</B>  " & child.Text  & "</LI>"

   <UL id=log>  
   </UL>  
</BODY>  
</HTML>  
<!-- EndRecordAndStreamVBS -->  
```  
  
 This example ASP page contains server-side VBScript that uses ADO to execute the FOR XML query and return the XML results in an XML data island, MyDataIsle. This XML data island is then returned in the browser for additional client-side processing. Additional client-side VBScript code is then used to process the contents of the XML data island. This process is performed before displaying the contents as part of the resultant DHTML and opening a message box to show the preprocessed contents of the XML data island.  
  
#### To test this example  
  
1.  Verify that IIS is installed and that the AdventureWorks sample database for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has been installed.  
  
     This example requires that Internet Information Services (IIS) version 5.0, or later versions, are installed with ASP support enabled. Also, the AdventureWorks sample database has to be installed.  
  
2.  Copy the code example that was previously provided and paste it into the XML or text editor that you use. Save the file as RetrieveResults.asp in the root directory that is used for IIS. Typically, this is C:Inetpub\wwwroot.  
  
3.  Open the ASP page in a browser window by using the following URL. First, replace 'MyServer' with either "localhost" or the actual name of the server where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and IIS are installed.  
  
    ```  
    http://MyServer/RetrieveResults.asp  
    ```  
  
 The generated HTML page results that appear will be similar to the following sample output:  
  
##### Server-side processing  
 Page Generated @ 3/11/2006 3:36:02 PM  
  
 Connect String = Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=MyServer;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;Integrated Security=SSPI;  
  
 ADO Version = 2.8  
  
 adoConn.State = 1  
  
 Query String = SELECT Demographics from Sales.Store WHERE CustomerID = 3 FOR XML AUTO  
  
 Pushing XML to client for processing  
  
##### Client-side processing of XML Document MyDataIsle  
  
-   **AnnualSales:** 1500000  
  
-   **AnnualRevenue:** 150000  
  
-   **BankName:** Primary International

 The VBScript message box will then show the following original, unfiltered XML data island contents that were returned by the FOR XML query results.  
  
```

```  
  
## Retrieving FOR XML Data with ASP.NET and the .NET Framework  
 As in the previous example, the following ASP.NET code shows the results of querying an **xml** data type column, Demographics, in the Sales.Store table of the AdventureWorks sample database. As in the previous example, the query looks for the instance value of this column for the row where the CustomerID is equal to 3.  
  
 In this example, the following Microsoft .NET Framework managed APIs are used to accomplish the return and rendering of the FOR XML query results:  
  
1.  **SqlConnection** is used to open a connection to SQL Server, based on the contents of a specified connection string variable, strConn.  
  
2.  **SqlDataAdapter** is then used as the data adapter and it uses the SQL connection and a specified SQL query string to execute the FOR XML query.  
  
3.  After the query has executed, the **SqlDataAdapter.Fill** method is then called and passed an instance of a **DataSet,** MyDataSet, in order to fill the data set with the output of the FOR XML query.  
  
4.  The **DataSet.GetXml** method is then called to return the query results as a string that can be displayed in the server-generated HTML page.

> [!NOTE]  
>  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]**xml** data type support lets you request that the result of a FOR XML query be returned as **xml** data type, instead of as string or image typed data, by specifying the [TYPE directive](../../relational-databases/xml/type-directive-in-for-xml-queries.md). When the TYPE directive is used in FOR XML queries, it provides programmatic access to the FOR XML results similar to that shown in [Use XML Data in Applications](../../relational-databases/xml/use-xml-data-in-applications.md).
