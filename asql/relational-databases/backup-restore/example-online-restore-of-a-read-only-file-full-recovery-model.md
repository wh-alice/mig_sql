# Example: Online Restore of a Read-Only File (Full Recovery Model)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This topic is relevant for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases under the full recovery model that contain multiple files or filegroups.  
  
 In this example, a database named `adb`, which uses the full recovery model, contains three filegroups. Filegroup `A` is read/write, and filegroup `B` and filegroup `C` are read-only. Initially, all of the filegroups are online.  
  
 A read-only file, `b1`, in filegroup `B` of database `adb` has to be restored. A backup was taken since the file became read-only; therefore, log backups are not required. Filegroup `B` is offline for the duration of the restore, but the remainder of the database remains online.  
  
## Restore Sequence  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The syntax for an online restore sequence is the same as for an offline restore sequence.  
  
 To restore the file, the database administrator uses the following restore sequence:  
  
```  
RESTORE DATABASE adb FILE='b1' FROM filegroup_B_backup  
WITH RECOVERY   
```  
  
 Filegroup B is now online.
