# Data Sources Supported (SSAS Tabular)
  This topic describes the types of data sources that can be used with tabular models.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_supported_ds"></a> Supported data sources for in-memory models  
 You can import data from the data sources in the following table. When you install [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], setup does not install the providers that are listed for each data source. Some providers might already be installed with other applications on your computer; in other cases you will need to download and install the provider.

Originally, connecting to PDW from Analysis Services required a special data provider. This provider was replaced in SQL Server 2012. Starting in SQL Server 2012, the SQL Server native client is used for connections to PDW/APS.

##  <a name="bkmk_supported_ds_dq"></a> Supported data sources for DirectQuery models  
 DirectQuery is an alternative to in-memory storage mode, routing queries to and returning results directly from backend data systems rather than storing all data inside the model (and in RAM once the model is loaded). Because Analysis Services has to formulate queries in the native database query syntax, a smaller subset of data sources are supported for this mode.

##  <a name="bkmk_tips"></a> Tips for choosing data sources  
  
Importing tables from relational databases saves you steps because *foreign key* relationships are used during import to create relationships between tables in the model designer.  
  
Importing multiple tables, and then deleting the ones you don't need, can also save you steps. If you import tables one at a time, you might still need to create relationships between the tables manually.  
  
Columns that contain similar data in different data sources are the basis of creating relationships within the model designer. When using heterogeneous data sources, choose tables that have columns that can be mapped to tables in other data sources that contain identical or similar data.  
  
OLE DB providers can sometimes offer faster performance for large scale data. When choosing between different providers for the same data source, you should try the OLE DB provider first.
