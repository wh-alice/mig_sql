# CURSOR_STATUS (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  A scalar function that allows the caller of a stored procedure to determine whether or not the procedure has returned a cursor and result set for a given parameter.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
CURSOR_STATUS   
     (  
          { 'local' , 'cursor_name' }   
          | { 'global' , 'cursor_name' }   
          | { 'variable' , 'cursor_variable' }   
     )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 'local'  
 Specifies a constant that indicates the source of the cursor is a local cursor name.  
  
 '*cursor_name*'  
 Is the name of the cursor. A cursor name must conform to the rules for identifiers.  
  
 'global'  
 Specifies a constant that indicates the source of the cursor is a global cursor name.  
  
 'variable'  
 Specifies a constant that indicates the source of the cursor is a local variable.  
  
 '*cursor_variable*'  
 Is the name of the cursor variable. A cursor variable must be defined using the **cursor** data type.  
  
## Return Types  
 **smallint**  
  
|Return value|Cursor name|Cursor variable|  
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|  
|1|The result set of the cursor has at least one row.<br /><br /> For insensitive and keyset cursors, the result set has at least one row.<br /><br /> For dynamic cursors, the result set can have zero, one, or more rows.|The cursor allocated to this variable is open.<br /><br /> For insensitive and keyset cursors, the result set has at least one row.<br /><br /> For dynamic cursors, the result set can have zero, one, or more rows.|  
|0|The result set of the cursor is empty.*|The cursor allocated to this variable is open, but the result set is definitely empty.*|  
|-1|The cursor is closed.|The cursor allocated to this variable is closed.|  
|-2|Not applicable.|Can be:<br /><br /> No cursor was assigned to this OUTPUT variable by the previously called procedure.<br /><br /> A cursor was assigned to this OUTPUT variable by the previously called procedure, but it was in a closed state upon completion of the procedure. Therefore, the cursor is deallocated and not returned to the calling procedure.<br /><br /> There is no cursor assigned to a declared cursor variable.|  
|-3|A cursor with the specified name does not exist.|A cursor variable with the specified name does not exist, or if one exists it has not yet had a cursor allocated to it.|  
  
 *Dynamic cursors never return this result.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses the `CURSOR_STATUS` function to show the status of a cursor before and after it is opened and closed.  
  
```  
CREATE TABLE #TMP  
(  
   ii int  
)  
GO  
  
INSERT INTO #TMP(ii) VALUES(1)  
INSERT INTO #TMP(ii) VALUES(2)  
INSERT INTO #TMP(ii) VALUES(3)  
  
GO  
  
--Create a cursor.  
DECLARE cur CURSOR  
FOR SELECT * FROM #TMP  
  
--Display the status of the cursor before and after opening  
--closing the cursor.  
  
SELECT CURSOR_STATUS('global','cur') AS 'After declare'  
OPEN cur  
SELECT CURSOR_STATUS('global','cur') AS 'After Open'  
CLOSE cur  
SELECT CURSOR_STATUS('global','cur') AS 'After Close'  
  
--Remove the cursor.  
DEALLOCATE cur  
  
--Drop the table.  
DROP TABLE #TMP  
  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 `After declare`  
  
 `---------------`  
  
 `-1`  
  
 `After Open`  
  
 `----------`  
  
 `1`  
  
 `After Close`  
  
 `-----------`  
  
 `-1`
