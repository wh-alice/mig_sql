# Register a Database As a DAC
  Use either the **Register Data-tier Application Wizard** or a Windows PowerShell script to build a data-tier application (DAC) definition that describes the objects in an existing database, and register the DAC definition in the **msdb** system database (**master** in [!INCLUDE[ssSDSFull](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)]).  
  
-   **Before you begin:**  [Limitations and Restrictions](#LimitationsRestrictions), [Permissions](#Permissions)  
  
-   **To upgrade a DAC, using:**  [The Register Data-tier Application Wizard](#UsingRegisterDACWizard), [PowerShell](#RegisterDACPowerShell)  
  
## Before You Begin  
 The registration process creates a DAC definition that defines the objects in the database. The combination of the DAC definition and the database form a DAC instance. If you register a database as a DAC on a managed instance of the Database Engine, the registered DAC will be incorporated into the SQL Server Utility the next time the utility collection set is sent from the instance to the Utility Control Point. The DAC will then be present in the **Deployed Data-tier Applications** node of the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] **Utility Explorer** and reported in the **Deployed Data-tier Applications** details page.  
  
###  <a name="LimitationsRestrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
 DAC registration can only be performed on a database in [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] Service Pack 4 (SP4) or later. DAC registration cannot be performed if a DAC is already registered for the database. For example, if the database was created by deploying a DAC, you cannot run the **Register Data-tier Application Wizard**.  
  
 You cannot register a DAC if the database has objects that are not supported in a DAC, or contained users. For more information about the types of objects supported in a DAC, see [DAC Support For SQL Server Objects and Versions](../../relational-databases/data-tier-applications/dac-support-for-sql-server-objects-and-versions.md).  
  
###  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Registering a DAC in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] requires at least ALTER ANY LOGIN and database scope VIEW DEFINITION permissions, SELECT permissions on **sys.sql_expression_dependencies**, and membership in the **dbcreator** fixed server role. Members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role or the built-in SQL Server system administrator account named **sa** can also register a DAC. Registering a DAC that does not contain logins in [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] requires membership in the **dbmanager** or **serveradmin** roles. Registering a DAC that contains logins in [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] requires membership in the **loginmanager** or **serveradmin** roles.  
  
##  <a name="UsingRegisterDACWizard"></a> Using the Register Data-tier Application Wizard  
 **To Register a DAC Using a Wizard**  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, expand the node for the instance containing the database to be registered as a DAC.  
  
2.  Expand the **Databases** node.  
  
3.  Right-click the database to be registered, point to **Tasks**, and then select **Register As Data-tier Applicationâ€¦**  
  
4.  Complete the wizard dialogs:  
  
    1.  [Introduction Page](#Introduction)  
  
    2.  [Set Properties Page](#Set_properties)  
  
    3.  [Validation and Summary Page](#Summary)  
  
    4.  [Register DAC Page](#Register)  
  
##  <a name="Introduction"></a> Introduction Page  
 This page describes the steps for registering a data-tier application.  
  
 **Do not show this page again.** - Click the check box to stop the page from being displayed in the future.  
  
 **Next >** - Proceeds to the **Set Properties** page.  
  
 **Cancel** - Terminates the wizard without registering a DAC.  
  
 [Using the Register Data-tier Application Wizard](#UsingRegisterDACWizard)  
  
##  <a name="Set_properties"></a> Set Properties Page  
 Use this page to specify DAC-level properties such as the application name and version.  
  
 **Application name.** - A string that specifies the name used to identify the DAC defintion, the field is been populated with the database name.  
  
 **Version.** - A numeric value that identifies the version of the DAC. The DAC version is used in Visual Studio to identify the version of the DAC that developers are working on. When deploying a DAC, the version is stored in the **msdb** database and can later be viewed under the **Data-tier Applications** node in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 **Description.** - Optional. Text that explains the purpose of the DAC. When deploying a DAC, the description is stored in the **msdb** database and can later be viewed under the **Data-tier Applications** node in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)].  
  
 **\< Previous** - Returns you to the **Introduction** page.  
  
 **Next >** - Verifies that a DAC can be built from the objects in the database, and displays the results in the **Validation and Summary** page.  
  
 **Cancel** - Terminates the wizard without registering the DAC.  
  
 [Using the Register Data-tier Application Wizard](#UsingRegisterDACWizard)  
  
##  <a name="Summary"></a> Validation and Summary Page

##  <a name="RegisterDACPowerShell"></a> Register a DAC Using PowerShell  
 **To register a database as a DAC using the Register() method in a PowerShell script**  
  
1.  Create a SMO Server object and set it to the instance that contains the database to be registered as a DAC.  
  
2.  Add a variable that specifies the name of the database.  
  
3.  Specify the metadata for the DAC, such as the DAC name, version, and description.  
  
4.  Run the Register method with the information specified above.  
  
### Example (PowerShell)  
 The following example registers a database named MyDB as a DAC.  
  
```  
## Set a SMO Server object to the default instance on the local computer.  
CD SQLSERVER:\SQL\localhost\DEFAULT  
$srv = get-item .  
  
## Specify the database to register as a DAC.  
$dbname = "MyDB"  
  
## Specify the DAC metadata.  
$applicationname = "MyApplication"  
$version = "1.0.0.0"  
$description = "This DAC defines the database used by my application."  
  
## Register the DAC.  
$registerunit = New-Object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Dac.DacExtractionUnit($srv, $dbname, $applicationname, $version)  
$registerunit.Description = $description  
$registerunit.Register()  
```
