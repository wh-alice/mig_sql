# Lesson 3: Synchronizing the Subscription to the Merge Publication
In this lesson, you will start the Merge Agent to initialize the subscription using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. You also use this procedure to synchronize with the Publisher. This lesson requires that you have completed the previous lesson, [Lesson 2: Creating a Subscription to the Merge Publication](../../../relational-databases/replication/tutorials/lesson-2-creating-a-subscription-to-the-merge-publication.md).  
  
### To start synchronization and initialize the subscription  
  
1.  Connect to the Subscriber in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], expand the server node, and then expand the **Replication** folder.  
  
2.  In the **Local Subscriptions** folder, right-click the subscription in the **SalesOrdersReplica** database, and then click **View Synchronization Status**.  
  
3.  Click **Start** to initialize the subscription.  
  
## Next Steps  
You have successfully run the Merge Agent to start synchronization and initialize the subscription. You can also insert, update, or delete data in the **SalesOrderHeader** or **SalesOrderDetail** tables at the Publisher or Subscriber, repeat this procedure when network connectivity is available to synchronize data between the Publisher and the Subscriber, and then query the **SalesOrderHeader** or **SalesOrderDetail** tables at the other server to view the replicated changes.  
  
This completes the Replicating Data with Mobile Clients tutorial. For a similar tutorial that uses transactional replication, see [Tutorial: Replicating Data Between Continuously Connected Servers](../../../relational-databases/replication/tutorials/tutorial-replicating-data-between-continuously-connected-servers.md).
