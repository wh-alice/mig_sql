# Supported Combinations of SharePoint and Reporting Services Server and Add-in (SQL Server 2016)
[!INCLUDE[feedback_stackoverflow_msdn_connect_md](../../../integration-services/includes/feedback-stackoverflow-msdn-connect-md.md)]

  A [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report server installed in SharePoint mode requires a version of SharePoint and the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in (rsSharePoint.msi) for SharePoint products, which you install on the SharePoint servers.  This topic summarizes the supported combinations.  
  
## Supported Combinations of SharePoint and Reporting Services Components  
 The following table summarizes the supported combinations of report server, the Reporting Services add-in for SharePoint products, and SharePoint products. Combinations that are not list in the following table are not supported

 *Exception: Power view integration is not supported.  
  
 For links to the add-in download pages, see [Where to find the Reporting Services add-in for SharePoint Products](../../../reporting-services/install/windows/where-to-find-the-reporting-services-add-in-for-sharepoint-products.md).  
  
 **Additional Notes:**  

- Be sure to upgrade to upgrade all of the SharePoint servers within the farm. This includes the App and Web Front End servers.

-   SharePoint 2016 support, including Power view integration, requires the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report server and the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in version of SQL Server 2016 or later.  

-   SharePoint 2013 support, including Power view integration, requires the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report server and the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in version of SQL Server 2012 SP1 or later.  
  
-   Power View was introduced in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql11-md.md)]. Therefore, Power View integration with SharePoint 2010 requires the [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql11-md.md)] or later of the add-in.  
  
-   The SQL Server 2008 R2 Add-In is not supported by SQL Server 2012 (or later) report servers. The SharePoint 2010 prerequisite installer automatically installs the SQL Server 2008 R2 Add-In. It must be uninstalled before installing newer versions of the add-in. In place upgrade of the add-in is not supported.  
  
-   **Upgrade:** SharePoint 2010 with the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Add-In installed, cannot be upgraded in-place to SharePoint 2013. SharePoint 2013 requires [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11SP1](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/sssql11sp1-md.md)] or later of the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in and report server. For more information on upgrade, see [Upgrade and Migrate Reporting Services](../../../reporting-services/install/windows/upgrade-and-migrate-reporting-services.md).
