# Working with a Connection
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../connect/jdbc/includes)]

  The following sections provide examples of the different ways to connect to a SQL Server database by using the [SQLServerConnection](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverconnection-class.md) class of the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you have problems connecting to SQL Server using the JDBC driver, see [Troubleshooting Connectivity](../../connect/jdbc/troubleshooting-connectivity.md) for suggestions on how to correct it.  
  
## Creating a Connection by Using the DriverManager Class  
 The simplest approach to creating a connection to a SQL Server database is to load the JDBC driver and call the getConnection method of the DriverManager class, as in the following:  
  
```  
Class.forName("com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver");  
String connectionUrl = "jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;database=AdventureWorks;integratedSecurity=true;"  
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionUrl);  
```  
  
 This technique will create a database connection using the first available driver in the list of drivers that can successfully connect with the given URL.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When using the sqljdbc4.jar class library, applications do not need to explicitly register or load the driver by using the Class.forName method. When the getConnection method of the DriverManager class is called, an appropriate driver is located from the set of registered JDBC drivers. For more information, see Using the JDBC Driver.  
  
## Creating a Connection by Using the SQLServerDriver Class  
 If you have to specify a particular driver in the list of drivers for DriverManager, you can create a database connection by using the [connect](../../connect/jdbc/reference/connect-method--sqlserverdriver-.md) method of the [SQLServerDriver](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverdriver-class.md) class, as in the following:  
  
```  
Driver d = (Driver) Class.forName("com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver").newInstance();  
String connectionUrl = "jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;database=AdventureWorks;integratedSecurity=true;"  
Connection con = d.connect(connectionUrl, new Properties());  
```  
  
## Creating a Connection by Using the SQLServerDataSource Class  
 If you have to create a connection by using the [SQLServerDataSource](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverdatasource-class.md) class, you can use various setter methods of the class before you call the [getConnection](../../connect/jdbc/reference/getconnection-method---.md) method, as in the following:  
  
```  
SQLServerDataSource ds = new SQLServerDataSource();  
ds.setUser("MyUserName");  
ds.setPassword("*****");  
ds.setServerName("localhost");  
ds.setPortNumber(1433);   
ds.setDatabaseName("AdventureWorks");  
Connection con = ds.getConnection();  
```  
  
## Creating a Connection that Targets a Very Specific Data Source  
 If you have to make a database connection that targets a very specific data source, there are a number of approaches that you can take. Each approach depends on the properties that you set by using the connection URL.  
  
 To connect to the default instance on a remote server, use the following:  
  
 `String url = "jdbc:sqlserver://MyServer;integratedSecurity=true;"`  
  
 To connect to a specific port on a server, use the following:  
  
 `String url = "jdbc:sqlserver://MyServer:1533;integratedSecurity=true;"`  
  
 To connect to a named instance on a server, use the following:  
  
 `String url = "jdbc:sqlserver://209.196.43.19;instanceName=INSTANCE1;integratedSecurity=true;"`  
  
 To connect to a specific database on a server, use the following:  
  
 `String url = "jdbc:sqlserver://172.31.255.255;database=AdventureWorks;integratedSecurity=true;"`  
  
 For more connection URL examples, see [Building the Connection URL](../../connect/jdbc/building-the-connection-url.md).  
  
## Creating a Connection with a Custom Login Time-out  
 If you have to adjust for server load or network traffic, you can create a connection that has a specific login time-out value described in seconds, as in the following:  
  
 `String url = "jdbc:sqlserver://MyServer;loginTimeout=90;integratedSecurity=true;"`  
  
## Create a Connection with Application-level Identity  
 If you have to use logging and profiling, you will have to identify your connection as originating from a specific application, as in the following:  
  
 `String url = "jdbc:sqlserver://MyServer;applicationName=MYAPP.EXE;integratedSecurity=true;"`  
  
## Closing a Connection  
 You can explicitly close a database connection by calling the [close](../../connect/jdbc/reference/close-method--sqlserverconnection-.md) method of the SQLServerConnection class, as in the following:  
  
 `con.close();`  
  
 This will release the database resources that the SQLServerConnection object is using, or return the connection to the connection pool in pooled scenarios.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Calling the close method will also roll back any pending transactions.
