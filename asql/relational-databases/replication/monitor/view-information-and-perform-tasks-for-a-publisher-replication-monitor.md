# View Information and Perform Tasks for a Publisher (Replication Monitor)
  Replication Monitor provides the following tabs that display information about the selected Publisher:  
  
-   **Publications**  
  
     This tab displays information about all publications at the selected Publisher.  
  
-   **Subscription Watch List**  
  
     This tab is intended to display information about subscriptions from all publications available at the selected Publisher that have errors, warnings, or the poorest performance. This tab is not displayed for Distributors running versions prior to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)].  
  
-   **Agents** tab  
  
     This tab displays detailed information about the agents and jobs that are used by all types of replication. The tab also allows you to start and stop each agent and job.
