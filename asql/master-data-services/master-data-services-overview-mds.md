# Master Data Services Overview (MDS)
  This topic describes the key data organization and management features of [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]. 
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] enables you to manage a master set of your organization's data. You can organize the data into models, create rules for updating the data, and control who updates the data. With Excel, you can share the master data set with other people in your organization. 
  
 >  For a description of the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] architecture, see the [Master Data Services -- The Basics](https://www.simple-talk.com/sql/database-delivery/master-data-services-basics) article on simple-talk.com. For information about the new features  in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)], see [What's New in Master Data Services &#40;MDS&#41;](../master-data-services/what-s-new-in-master-data-services-mds.md)  
   **For instructions on how to install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], set up the database and Website, and deploy the sample models, see** [Master Data Services Installation and Configuration](../master-data-services/master-data-services-installation-and-configuration.md).  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], the model is the highest level container in the structure of your master data. You create a model to manage groups of similar data, for example to manage online product data. A model contains one or more entities, and entities contain members that are the data records. An entity is similar to a table.  
  
 For example, your online product model may contain entities such as product, color, and style. The  color entity may contain  members for the colors red, silver, and black.  
  
 ![Color entity](../master-data-services/media/mds-productmodel-colorentity-composite.png "Color entity")  
  
 Models also contain attributes that are defined within entities. An attribute contains values that help describe the entity members. There are free-form attributes and domain-based attributes.  A domain-based attribute contains values that are populated by members from an entity and can be used as attribute values for other entities.  
  
 For example, the product entity might have free-form attributes for cost and weight. And, there is a domain-based attribute for color ![Number 1](../master-data-services/media/mds-number1.png "Number 1") that contains values that are populated by the color entity members. This  master list of colors is used as attribute values for the Product entity ![Number 2](../master-data-services/media/mds-number2.png "Number 2").  
  
 ![Domain-based attribute for color](../master-data-services/media/mds-productentity-color-domainattribute.png "Domain-based attribute for color")  
  
 Derived hierarchies come from the relationships between entities in a model. These are domain-based attribute relationships. In the product model for example, you can have a color derived hierarchy ![Number 1](../master-data-services/media/mds-number1.png "Number 1") that comes from the relationship between the color ![Number 2](../master-data-services/media/mds-number2.png "Number 2") and product ![Number 3](../master-data-services/media/mds-number3.png "Number 3") entities.  
  
 ![Color derived hierarchy](../master-data-services/media/mds-derivedhierarchy.png "Color derived hierarchy")  
  
 Once you've defined  a basic structure for your data, you can start adding data records (members) by using the import feature. You load data into staging tables,  validate the data using business rules, and load the data into  MDS tables.  You can also use business rules to set attribute values.  
  
 The following table outlines the key [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] tasks. Unless otherwise noted, all of the following procedures require you to be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You might want to complete the following tasks in a test environment and use the sample data provided when you install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]. For more information, see [Deploying Models &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/deploying-models-master-data-services.md).

|Lock a version of your model and assign a version flag|Lock a version of your model to prevent changes to the members, except by administrators. When the version's data has validated successfully against business rules, you can commit the version, which prevents changes to members by all users.<br /><br /> Create and assign a version flag to the model. Flags help users and subscribing systems identify which version of a model to use.|[Versions &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/versions-master-data-services.md)<br /><br /> [Lock a Version &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/lock-a-version-master-data-services.md)<br /><br /> [Create a Version Flag &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/create-a-version-flag-master-data-services.md)|
