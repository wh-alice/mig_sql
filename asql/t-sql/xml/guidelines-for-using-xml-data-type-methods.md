# Guidelines for Using xml Data Type Methods
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This topic describes guidelines for using the **xml** data type methods.  
  
## The PRINT Statement  
 The **xml** data type methods cannot be used in the PRINT statement as shown in the following example. The **xml** data type methods are treated as subqueries, and subqueries are not allowed in the PRINT statement. As a result, the following example returns an error:  
  
```  
DECLARE @x xml  
SET @x = '<root>Hello</root>'  
PRINT @x.value('/root[1]', 'varchar(20)') -- will not work because this is treated as a subquery (select top 1 col from table)   
```  
  
 A solution is to first assign the result of the **value()** method to a variable of **xml** type and then specify the variable in the query.  
  
```  
DECLARE @x xml  
DECLARE @c varchar(max)  
SET @x = '<root>Hello</root>'  
SET @c = @x.value('/root[1]', 'varchar(11)')  
PRINT @c                                                        
```  
  
## The GROUP BY Clause  
 The **xml** data type methods are treated internally as subqueries. Because GROUP BY requires a scalar and does not allow aggregates and subqueries, you cannot specify the **xml** data type methods in the GROUP BY clause. A solution is to call a user-defined function that uses XML methods inside of it.  
  
## Reporting Errors  
 When reporting errors, **xml** data type methods raise a single error in the following format:  
  
```  
Msg errorNumber, Level levelNumber, State stateNumber:  
XQuery [database.table.method]: description_of_error  
```  
  
 For example:  
  
```  
Msg 2396, Level 16, State 1:  
XQuery [xmldb_test.xmlcol.query()]: Attribute may not appear outside of an element  
```  
  
## Singleton Checks  
 Location steps, function parameters, and operators that require singletons will return an error if the compiler cannot determine whether a singleton is guaranteed at run time. This problem occurs frequently with untyped data. For example, the lookup of an attribute requires a singleton parent element. An ordinal that selects a single parent node is sufficient. The evaluation of a **node()**-**value()** combination to extract attribute values may not require the ordinal specification. This is shown in the next example.  
  
### Example: Known Singleton  
 In this example, the **nodes()** method generates a separate row for each <`book`> element. The **value()** method that is evaluated on a <`book`> node extracts the value of @genre and, being an attribute, is a singleton.  
  
```  
SELECT nref.value('@genre', 'varchar(max)') LastName  
FROM   T CROSS APPLY xCol.nodes('//book') AS R(nref)  
```  
  
 XML schema is used for type checking of typed XML. If a node is specified as a singleton in the XML schema, the compiler uses that information and no error occurs. Otherwise, an ordinal that selects a single node is required. In particular, the use of descendant-or-self axis (//) axis, such as in /book//title, looses singleton cardinality inference for the \<title> element, even if the XML schema specifies it to be so. Therefore, you should rewrite it as (/book//title)[1].  
  
 It is important to remain aware of the difference between //first-name[1] and (//first-name)[1] for type checking. The former returns a sequence of \<first-name> nodes in which each node is the leftmost \<first-name> node among its siblings. The latter returns the first singleton \<first-name> node in document order in the XML instance.  
  
### Example: Using value()  
 The following query on an untyped XML column results in a static, compilation error.This is because **value()** expects a singleton node as the first argument and the compiler cannot determine whether only one \<last-name> node will occur at run time:  
  
```  
SELECT xCol.value('//author/last-name', 'nvarchar(50)') LastName  
FROM   T  
```  
  
 Following is a solution that you could consider:  
  
```  
SELECT xCol.value('//author/last-name[1]', 'nvarchar(50)') LastName  
FROM   T  
```  
  
 However, this solution does not solve the error, because multiple <`author`> nodes may occur in each XML instance. The following rewrite works:  
  
```  
SELECT xCol.value('(//author/last-name/text())[1]', 'nvarchar(50)') LastName  
FROM   T  
```  
  
 This query returns the value of the first `<last-name>` element in each XML instance.
