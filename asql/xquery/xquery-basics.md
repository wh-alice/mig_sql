# XQuery Basics
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This section describes the fundamentals of XQuery.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Sequence and QNames &#40;XQuery&#41;](../xquery/sequence-and-qnames-xquery.md)  
 Describes sequence and also QNames and predefined namespaces.  
  
 [Expression Context and Query Evaluation &#40;XQuery&#41;](../xquery/expression-context-and-query-evaluation-xquery.md)  
 Describes the two contexts in which XQuery is evaluated. These two contexts are static and dynamic.  
  
 [Atomization &#40;XQuery&#41;](../xquery/atomization-xquery.md)  
 Describes atomization, which is a process of extracting the typed value of an item.  
  
 [Effective Boolean Value &#40;XQuery&#41;](../xquery/effective-boolean-value-xquery.md)  
 Describes the effective Boolean value. This value can be computed for expressions that return a single Boolean value, a node sequence, or an empty sequence.  
  
 [Type System &#40;XQuery&#41;](../xquery/type-system-xquery.md)  
 Describes the XQuery type system with various predefined types. XQuery is a strongly typed language for schema types and a weakly typed language for untyped data.  
  
 [Error Handling &#40;XQuery&#41;](../xquery/error-handling-xquery.md)  
 Describes the handling of static, dynamic, and type errors in XQuery.  
  
 [Comments in XQuery](../xquery/comments-in-xquery.md)  
 Describes how to add comments in XQuery by using the "`(:`" and "`:)`" delimiters  
  
 [XQuery and Static Typing](../xquery/xquery-and-static-typing.md)  
 Describes XQuery in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as a statically typed language
