# RelationshipType Element (ASSL)
  Indicates whether member relationships for an [AttributeRelationship](../../../analysis-services/scripting/objects/attributerelationship-element-assl.md) can be changed.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
  
<AttributeRelationship>  
   ...  
   <RelationshipType>...</RelationshipType>  
   ...  
</AttributeRelationship>  
```  
  
## Element Characteristics

|Data type and length|String (enumeration)|  
|Default value|*Flexible*|  
|Cardinality|0-1: Optional element that can occur once and only once.|

|Child elements|None|  
  
## Remarks  
 The value of this element is limited to one of the strings listed in the following table.

|-----------|-----------------|  
|*Rigid*|The member relationships between an attribute and a related attribute cannot be changed.|
