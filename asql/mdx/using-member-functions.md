# Using Member Functions
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  A member function is an Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) function that returns a member. Member functions, like tuple functions and set functions, are essential to negotiating the multidimensional structures found in [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 Of the many member functions in MDX, the most important is the **CurrentMember** function, which is used to determine the current member on a hierarchy. The following query illustrates how to use it, along with the **Parent**, **Ancestor**, and **Prevmember** functions:  
  
 `WITH`  
  
 `//Returns the name of the currentmember on the Calendar hierarchy`  
  
 `MEMBER MEASURES.[CurrentMemberDemo] AS [Date].[Calendar].CurrentMember.Name`  
  
 `//Returns the name of the parent of the currentmember on the Calendar hierarchy`  
  
 `MEMBER MEASURES.[ParentDemo] AS [Date].[Calendar].CurrentMember.Parent.Name`  
  
 `//Returns the name of the ancestor of the currentmember on the Calendar hierarchy at the Year level`  
  
 `MEMBER MEASURES.[AncestorDemo] AS ANCESTOR([Date].[Calendar].CurrentMember, [Date].[Calendar].[Calendar Year]).Name`  
  
 `//Returns the name of the member before the currentmember on the Calendar hierarchy`  
  
 `MEMBER MEASURES.[PrevMemberDemo] AS [Date].[Calendar].CurrentMember.Prevmember.Name`  
  
 `SELECT{MEASURES.[CurrentMemberDemo],MEASURES.[ParentDemo],MEASURES.[AncestorDemo],MEASURES.[PrevMemberDemo] } ON 0,`  
  
 `[Date].[Calendar].MEMBERS ON 1`  
  
 `FROM [Adventure Works]`
