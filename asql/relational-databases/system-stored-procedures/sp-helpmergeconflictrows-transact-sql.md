[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns the rows in the specified conflict table. This stored procedure is run on the computer where the conflict table is stored.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../Topic/Transact-SQL%20Syntax%20Conventions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_helpmergeconflictrows [ [ @publication = ] 'publication' ]  
        , [ @conflict_table = ] 'conflict_table'  
    [ , [ @publisher = ] 'publisher' ]   
    [ , [ @publisher_db = ] 'publsher_db' ]   
    [ , [ @logical_record_conflicts = ] logical_record_conflicts ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@publication=**] **'***publication***'**  
 Is the name of the publication. *publication* is **sysname**, with a default of **%**. If the publication is specified, all conflicts qualified by the publication are returned. For example, if the **MSmerge_conflict_Customers** table has conflict rows for the **WA** and the **CA** publications, passing in a publication name **CA** retrieves conflicts that pertain to the **CA** publication.  
  
 [ **@conflict_table=**] **'***conflict_table***'**  
 Is the name of the conflict table. *conflict_table* is **sysname**, with no default. In [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] and later versions, conflict tables are named using the format names with **MSmerge_conflict_*publication*_*article***, with one table for each published article.  
  
 [ **@publisher=**] **'***publisher***'**  
 Is the name of the Publisher. *publisher* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@publisher_db=**] **'***publisher_db***'**  
 Is the name of the publisher database.*publisher_db* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@logical_record_conflicts=** ] *logical_record_conflicts*  
 Indicates whether the result set contains information about logical record conflicts. *logical_record_conflicts* is **int**, with a default value of 0. **1** means that logical record conflict information is returned.  
  
## Result Sets  
 **sp_helpmergeconflictrows** returns a result set consisting of the base table structure and these additional columns.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**origin_datasource**|**varchar(255)**|Origin of the conflict.|  
|**conflict_type**|**int**|Code indicating the type of conflict:<br /><br /> **1** = Update Conflict: The conflict is detected at the row level.<br /><br /> **2** = Column Update Conflict: The conflict detected at the column level.<br /><br /> **3** = Update Delete Wins Conflict: The delete wins the conflict.<br /><br /> **4** = Update Wins Delete Conflict: The deleted rowguid that loses the conflict is recorded in this table.<br /><br /> **5** = Upload Insert Failed: The insert from Subscriber could not be applied at the Publisher.<br /><br /> **6** = Download Insert Failed: The insert from Publisher could not be applied at the Subscriber.<br /><br /> **7** = Upload Delete Failed: The delete at Subscriber could not be uploaded to the Publisher.<br /><br /> **8** = Download Delete Failed: The delete at Publisher could not be downloaded to the Subscriber.<br /><br /> **9** = Upload Update Failed: The update at Subscriber could not be applied at the Publisher.<br /><br /> **10** = Download Update Failed: The update at Publisher could not be applied to the Subscriber.<br /><br /> **12** = Logical Record Update Wins Delete: The deleted logical record that loses the conflict is recorded in this table.<br /><br /> **13** = Logical Record Conflict Insert Update: Insert to a logical record conflicts with an update.<br /><br /> **14** = Logical Record Delete Wins Update Conflict: The updated logical record that loses the conflict is recorded in this table.|  
|**reason_code**|**int**|Error code that can be context-sensitive.|  
|**reason_text**|**varchar(720)**|Error description that can be context-sensitive.|  
|**pubid**|**uniqueidentifier**|Publication identifier.|  
|**MSrepl_create_time**|**datetime**|Time the conflict information was added.|
