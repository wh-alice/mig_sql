# Business Rule Conditions (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], business rule conditions determine the conditions that must be true for one or more actions to be taken.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Conditions are optional. If you do not specify a condition, then actions are taken any time data is validated against business rules.
