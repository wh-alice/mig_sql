# sp_restoredbreplication (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Removes replication settings if restoring a database to the non-originating server, database, or system that is otherwise not capable of running replication processes. When restoring a replicated database to a server or database other than the one where the backup was taken, replication settings cannot be preserved. On the restore, the server calls **sp_restoredbreplication** directly to automatically remove replication metadata from the restored database.
