# Lesson 1-5 - Adding and Configuring the Flat File Source
In this task, you will add and configure a Flat File source to your package. A Flat File source is a data flow component that uses metadata defined by a Flat File connection manager to specify the format and structure of the data to be extracted from the flat file by a transform process. The Flat File source can be configured to extract data from a single flat file by using the file format definition provided by the Flat File connection manager.  
  
For this tutorial, you will configure the Flat File source to use the **Sample Flat File Source Data** connection manager that you previously created.  
  
### To add a Flat File Source component  
  
1.  Open the **Data Flow** designer, either by double-clicking the **Extract Sample Currency Data** data flow task or by clicking the **Data Flow tab**.  
  
2.  In the **SSIS Toolbox**, expand **OtherSources**, and then drag a **Flat File Source** onto the design surface of the **Data Flow** tab.  
  
3.  On the **Data Flow** design surface, right-click the newly added **Flat File Source**, click **Rename**, and change the name to **Extract Sample Currency Data**.  
  
4.  Double-click the Flat File source to open the Flat File Source Editor dialog box.  
  
5.  In the **Flat file connection manager** box, select **Sample Flat File Source Data**.  
  
6.  Click **Columns** and verify that the names of the columns are correct.  
  
7.  Click **OK**.  
  
8.  Right-click the Flat File source and click **Properties**.  
  
9. In the Properties window, verify that the **LocaleID** property is set to **English (United States)**.
