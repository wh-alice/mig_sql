# sys.databases (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Contains one row per database in the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 If a database is not ONLINE, or AUTO_CLOSE is set to ON and the database is closed, the values of some columns may be NULL. If a database is OFFLINE, the corresponding row is not visible to low-privileged users. To see the corresponding row if the database is OFFLINE, a user must have at least the ALTER ANY DATABASE server-level permission, or the CREATE DATABASE permission in the **master** database.  
  
 **Columns that are relevant to [!INCLUDE[ssGeoDR](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/includes/ssgeodr-md.md)] for [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)]:** is_ready_only, state, and state_desc.

## Permissions  
 If the caller of **sys.databases** is not the owner of the database and the database is not **master** or **tempdb**, the minimum permissions required to see the corresponding row are ALTER ANY DATABASE or VIEW ANY DATABASE server-level permission, or CREATE DATABASE permission in the **master** database. The database to which the caller is connected can always be viewed in **sys.databases**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  By default, the public role has the VIEW ANY DATABASE permission, allowing all logins to see database information. To block a login from the ability to detect a database, REVOKE the VIEW ANY DATABASE permission from public, or DENY the VIEW ANY DATABASE permission for individual logins.  
  
## [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] Remarks  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)], this view is available in the **master** database and in user databases. In the **master** database, this view returns the information on the **master** database and all user databases on the server. In a user database, this view returns information only on the current database and the master database.  
  
 Use the **sys.databases** view in the **master** database of the [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] server where the new database is being created. After the database copy starts, you can query the **sys.databases** and the **sys.dm_database_copies** views from the **master** database of the destination server to retrieve more information about the copying progress.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Query the sys.databases view  
 The following example returns a few of the columns available in the **sys.databases** view.  
  
```  
SELECT name, user_access_desc, is_read_only, state_desc, recovery_model_desc  
FROM sys.databases;  
```  
  
### B. Check the copying status in [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)]  
 The following example queries the **sys.databases** and **sys.dm_database_copies** views to return information about a database copy operation.  
  
||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)]|  
  
```  
-- Execute from the master database.  
SELECT a.name, a.state_desc, b.start_date, b.modify_date, b.percentage_complete  
FROM sys.databases AS a  
INNER JOIN sys.dm_database_copies AS b ON a.database_id = b.database_id  
WHERE a.state = 7;  
```  
### C. Check the temporal retention policy status in [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)]  
 The following example queries the **sys.databases** to return information whether temporal retention cleanup task is enabled. Be aware that after restore operation temporal retention is **disabled** by default. Use ALTER DATABASE to enable it explicitly.

|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)]|

FROM sys.databases AS a;
