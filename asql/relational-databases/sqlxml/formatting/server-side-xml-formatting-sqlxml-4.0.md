# Server-side XML Formatting (SQLXML 4.0)
  This topic provides information about formatting XML documents on the server side from the rowsets that are generated by queries executed against a database in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can store and retrieve XML documents to and from database tables. To retrieve an XML document, use the FOR XML query extension in a SELECT query.  
  
 For example, assume a client application executes a command against [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that consists of the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] query:  
  
```  
SELECT FirstName, LastName  
FROM   Person.Contact  
FOR XML AUTO  
```  
  
 The server executes the query in two steps. First, the server executes this SELECT statement:  
  
```  
SELECT FirstName, LastName  
FROM   Person.Contact  
```  
  
 Then the server applies the FOR XML transformation to the generated rowset. The resulting XML is then sent to the client as a one-column rowset. In this documentation, this process is referred to as server-side XML formatting.  
  
 On the server side, you can specify the following modes with a FOR XML clause:  
  
-   RAW  
  
-   AUTO  
  
-   EXPLICIT  
  
 For more information about the FOR XML clause, see [Constructing XML Using FOR XML](../../../relational-databases/xml/for-xml-sql-server.md).
