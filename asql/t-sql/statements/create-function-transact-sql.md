# CREATE FUNCTION (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Creates a user-defined function in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssdsfull-md.md)]. A user-defined function is a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] or common language runtime (CLR) routine that accepts parameters, performs an action, such as a complex calculation, and returns the result of that action as a value. The return value can either be a scalar (single) value or a table. Use this statement to create a reusable routine that can be used in these ways:  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements such as SELECT  
  
-   In applications calling the function  
  
-   In the definition of another user-defined function  
  
-   To parameterize a view or improve the functionality of an indexed view  
  
-   To define a column in a table  
  
-   To define a CHECK constraint on a column  
  
-   To replace a stored procedure  
  
-   Use an inline function as a filter predicate for a security policy  
  
> [!NOTE]

## Arguments
*OR ALTER*  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: Azure [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1).|  
  
 Conditionally alters the function only if it already exists. 
 
> [!NOTE]  
>  Optional [OR ALTER] syntax for CLR is available starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1 CU1.   
 
 *schema_name*  
 Is the name of the schema to which the user-defined function belongs.  
  
 *function_name*  
 Is the name of the user-defined function. Function names must comply with the rules for [identifiers](../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md) and must be unique within the database and to its schema.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Parentheses are required after the function name even if a parameter is not specified.  
  
 @*parameter_name*  
 Is a parameter in the user-defined function. One or more parameters can be declared.  
  
 A function can have a maximum of 2,100 parameters. The value of each declared parameter must be supplied by the user when the function is executed, unless a default for the parameter is defined.  
  
 Specify a parameter name by using an at sign (@) as the first character. The parameter name must comply with the rules for identifiers. Parameters are local to the function; the same parameter names can be used in other functions. Parameters can take the place only of constants; they cannot be used instead of table names, column names, or the names of other database objects.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  ANSI_WARNINGS is not honored when you pass parameters in a stored procedure, user-defined function, or when you declare and set variables in a batch statement. For example, if a variable is defined as **char(3)**, and then set to a value larger than three characters, the data is truncated to the defined size and the INSERT or UPDATE statement succeeds.  
  
 [ *type_schema_name*. ] *parameter_data_type*  
 Is the parameter data type, and optionally the schema to which it belongs. For [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types and user-defined table types, are allowed except the **timestamp** data type. For CLR functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except **text**, **ntext**, **image**, user-defined table types and **timestamp** data types. The nonscalar types, **cursor** and **table**, cannot be specified as a parameter data type in either [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] or CLR functions.  
  
 If *type_schema_name* is not specified, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] looks for the *scalar_parameter_data_type* in the following order:  
  
-   The schema that contains the names of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system data types.  
  
-   The default schema of the current user in the current database.  
  
-   The **dbo** schema in the current database.  
  
 [ =*default* ]  
 Is a default value for the parameter. If a *default* value is defined, the function can be executed without specifying a value for that parameter.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Default parameter values can be specified for CLR functions except for the **varchar(max)** and **varbinary(max)** data types.  
  
 When a parameter of the function has a default value, the keyword DEFAULT must be specified when the function is called to retrieve the default value. This behavior is different from using parameters with default values in stored procedures in which omitting the parameter also implies the default value. However, the DEFAULT keyword is not required when invoking a scalar function by using the EXECUTE statement.  
  
 READONLY  
 Indicates that the parameter cannot be updated or modified within the definition of the function. If the parameter type is a user-defined table type, READONLY should be specified.  
  
 *return_data_type*  
 Is the return value of a scalar user-defined function. For [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except the **timestamp** data type. For CLR functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except the **text**, **ntext**, **image**, and **timestamp** data types. The nonscalar types, **cursor** and **table**, cannot be specified as a return data type in either [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] or CLR functions.  
  
 *function_body*  
 Specifies that a series of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, which together do not produce a side effect such as modifying a table, define the value of the function. *function_body* is used only in scalar functions and multistatement table-valued functions.  
  
 In scalar functions, *function_body* is a series of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that together evaluate to a scalar value.  
  
 In multistatement table-valued functions, *function_body* is a series of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that populate a TABLE return variable.  
  
 *scalar_expression*  
 Specifies the scalar value that the scalar function returns.  
  
 TABLE  
 Specifies that the return value of the table-valued function is a table. Only constants and @*local_variables* can be passed to table-valued functions.  
  
 In inline table-valued functions, the TABLE return value is defined through a single SELECT statement. Inline functions do not have associated return variables.  
  
 In multistatement table-valued functions, @*return_variable* is a TABLE variable, used to store and accumulate the rows that should be returned as the value of the function. @*return_variable* can be specified only for [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions and not for CLR functions.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  Joining to a multistatement table valued function in a **FROM** clause is possible, but can give poor performance. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is unable to use all the optimized techniques against some statements that can be included in a multistatement function, resulting in a suboptimal query plan. To obtain the best possible performance, whenever possible use joins between base tables instead of functions.  
  
 *select_stmt*  
 Is the single SELECT statement that defines the return value of an inline table-valued function.  
  
 ORDER (<order_clause>)  
 Specifies the order in which results are being returned from the table-valued function. For more information, see the section, "Guidance on Using Sort Order," later in this topic.  
  
 EXTERNAL NAME <method_specifier> *assembly_name*.*class_name*.*method_name*  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Specifies the assembly and method to which the created function name shall refer.  
  
-   *assembly_name* - must match a value in the `name` column of   
    `SELECT * FROM sys.assemblies;`.  
    This is the name that was used on the `CREATE ASSEMBLY` statement.  
  
-   *class_name* - must match a value in the `assembly_name` column of  
    `SELECT * FROM sys.assembly_modules;`.  
    Often the value contains an embedded period or dot. In such cases the Transact-SQL syntax requires that the value be bounded with a pair of straight brackets [], or with a pair of double quotation marks "".  
  
-   *method_name* - must match a value in the `method_name` column of   
    `SELECT * FROM sys.assembly_modules;`.  
    The method must be static.  
  
 In a typical example, for MyFood.DLL, in which all types are in the MyFood namespace, the `EXTERNAL NAME` value could be:   
`MyFood.[MyFood.MyClass].MyStaticMethod`  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  By default, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cannot execute CLR code. You can create, modify, and drop database objects that reference common language runtime modules; however, you cannot execute these references in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] until you enable the [clr enabled option](../../database-engine/configure/windows/clr-enabled-server-configuration-option.md). To enable this option, use [sp_configure](../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is not available in a contained database.  
  
 *\<*table_type_definition*>* ( { <column_definition> <column_constraint>    | <computed_column_definition> }    [ <table_constraint> ] [ ,...*n* ] )  
 Defines the table data type for a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] function. The table declaration includes column definitions and column or table constraints. The table is always put in the primary filegroup.  
  
 \< clr_table_type_definition >  ( { *column_name**data_type* } [ ,...*n* ] )  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[sqldbesa](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sqldbesa-md.md)] ([Preview in some regions](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-preview-whats-new/?WT.mc_id=TSQL_GetItTag)).|  
  
 Defines the table data types for a CLR function. The table declaration includes only column names and data types. The table is always put in the primary filegroup.  
  
 NULL|NOT NULL  
 Supported only for natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions. For more information, see [Scalar User-Defined Functions for In-Memory OLTP](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/scalar-user-defined-functions-for-in-memory-oltp.md).  
  
 NATIVE_COMPILATION  
 Indicates whether a user-defined function is natively compiled. This argument is required for natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions.  
  
 BEGIN ATOMIC WITH  
 Supported only for natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions, and is required. For more information, see [Atomic Blocks](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/atomic-blocks-in-native-procedures.md).  
  
 SCHEMABINDING  
 The SCHEMABINDING argument is required for natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions.  
  
 EXECUTE AS  
 EXECUTE AS is required for natively compiled, scalar user-defined functions.  
  
 **<function_option>::= and <clr_function_option>::=**  
  
 Specifies that the function will have one or more of the following options.  
  
 ENCRYPTION  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Indicates that the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] will convert the original text of the CREATE FUNCTION statement to an obfuscated format. The output of the obfuscation is not directly visible in any catalog views. Users that have no access to system tables or database files cannot retrieve the obfuscated text. However, the text will be available to privileged users that can either access system tables over the [DAC port](../../database-engine/configure/windows/diagnostic-connection-for-database-administrators.md) or directly access database files. Also, users that can attach a debugger to the server process can retrieve the original procedure from memory at runtime. For more information about accessing system metadata, see [Metadata Visibility Configuration](../../relational-databases/security/metadata-visibility-configuration.md).  
  
 Using this option prevents the function from being published as part of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] replication. This option cannot be specified for CLR functions.  
  
 SCHEMABINDING  
 Specifies that the function is bound to the database objects that it references. When SCHEMABINDING is specified, the base objects cannot be modified in a way that would affect the function definition. The function definition itself must first be modified or dropped to remove dependencies on the object that is to be modified.  
  
 The binding of the function to the objects it references is removed only when one of the following actions occurs: 
  
-   The function is dropped.  
  
-   The function is modified by using the ALTER statement with the SCHEMABINDING option not specified.  
  
 A function can be schema bound only if the following conditions are true:  
  
-   The function is a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] function.  
  
-   The user-defined functions and views referenced by the function are also schema-bound.  
  
-   The objects referenced by the function are referenced using a two-part name.  
  
-   The function and the objects it references belong to the same database.  
  
-   The user who executed the CREATE FUNCTION statement has REFERENCES permission on the database objects that the function references.  
  
 RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT | **CALLED ON NULL INPUT**  
 Specifies the **OnNULLCall** attribute of a scalar-valued function. If not specified, CALLED ON NULL INPUT is implied by default. This means that the function body executes even if NULL is passed as an argument.  
  
 If RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT is specified in a CLR function, it indicates that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can return NULL when any of the arguments it receives is NULL, without actually invoking the body of the function. If the method of a CLR function specified in <method_specifier> already has a custom attribute that indicates RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT, but the CREATE FUNCTION statement indicates CALLED ON NULL INPUT, the CREATE FUNCTION statement takes precedence. The **OnNULLCall** attribute cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 EXECUTE AS Clause  
 Specifies the security context under which the user-defined function is executed. Therefore, you can control which user account [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses to validate permissions on any database objects that are referenced by the function.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  EXECUTE AS cannot be specified for inline user-defined functions.  
  
 For more information, see [EXECUTE AS Clause &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/execute-as-clause-transact-sql.md).  
  
 **\< column_definition >::=**  
  
 Defines the table data type. The table declaration includes column definitions and constraints. For CLR functions, only *column_name* and *data_type* can be specified.  
  
 *column_name*  
 Is the name of a column in the table. Column names must comply with the rules for identifiers and must be unique in the table. *column_name* can consist of 1 through 128 characters.  
  
 *data_type*  
 Specifies the column data type. For [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except **timestamp**. For CLR functions, all data types, including CLR user-defined types, are allowed except **text**, **ntext**, **image**, **char**, **varchar**, **varchar(max)**, and **timestamp**.The nonscalar type **cursor** cannot be specified as a column data type in either [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] or CLR functions.  
  
 DEFAULT *constant_expression*  
 Specifies the value provided for the column when a value is not explicitly supplied during an insert. *constant_expression* is a constant, NULL, or a system function value. DEFAULT definitions can be applied to any column except those that have the IDENTITY property. DEFAULT cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 COLLATE *collation_name*  
 Specifies the collation for the column. If not specified, the column is assigned the default collation of the database. Collation name can be either a Windows collation name or a SQL collation name. For a list of and more information about collations, see [Windows Collation Name &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/windows-collation-name-transact-sql.md) and [SQL Server Collation Name &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/sql-server-collation-name-transact-sql.md).  
  
 The COLLATE clause can be used to change the collations only of columns of the **char**, **varchar**, **nchar**, and **nvarchar** data types.  
  
 COLLATE cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 ROWGUIDCOL  
 Indicates that the new column is a row globally unique identifier column. Only one **uniqueidentifier** column per table can be designated as the ROWGUIDCOL column. The ROWGUIDCOL property can be assigned only to a **uniqueidentifier** column.  
  
 The ROWGUIDCOL property does not enforce uniqueness of the values stored in the column. It also does not automatically generate values for new rows inserted into the table. To generate unique values for each column, use the NEWID function on INSERT statements. A default value can be specified; however, NEWID cannot be specified as the default.  
  
 IDENTITY  
 Indicates that the new column is an identity column. When a new row is added to the table, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides a unique, incremental value for the column. Identity columns are typically used together with PRIMARY KEY constraints to serve as the unique row identifier for the table. The IDENTITY property can be assigned to **tinyint**, **smallint**, **int**, **bigint**, **decimal(p,0)**, or **numeric(p,0)** columns. Only one identity column can be created per table. Bound defaults and DEFAULT constraints cannot be used with an identity column. You must specify both the *seed* and *increment* or neither. If neither is specified, the default is (1,1).  
  
 IDENTITY cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 *seed*  
 Is the integer value to be assigned to the first row in the table.  
  
 *increment*  
 Is the integer value to add to the *seed* value for successive rows in the table.  
  
 **\< column_constraint >::= and \< table_constraint>::=**  
  
 Defines the constraint for a specified column or table. For CLR functions, the only constraint type allowed is NULL. Named constraints are not allowed.  
  
 NULL | NOT NULL  
 Determines whether null values are allowed in the column. NULL is not strictly a constraint but can be specified just like NOT NULL. NOT NULL cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 PRIMARY KEY  
 Is a constraint that enforces entity integrity for a specified column through a unique index. In table-valued user-defined functions, the PRIMARY KEY constraint can be created on only one column per table. PRIMARY KEY cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 UNIQUE  
 Is a constraint that provides entity integrity for a specified column or columns through a unique index. A table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints. UNIQUE cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 CLUSTERED | NONCLUSTERED  
 Indicate that a clustered or a nonclustered index is created for the PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint. PRIMARY KEY constraints use CLUSTERED, and UNIQUE constraints use NONCLUSTERED.  
  
 CLUSTERED can be specified for only one constraint. If CLUSTERED is specified for a UNIQUE constraint and a PRIMARY KEY constraint is also specified, the PRIMARY KEY uses NONCLUSTERED.  
  
 CLUSTERED and NONCLUSTERED cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 CHECK  
 Is a constraint that enforces domain integrity by limiting the possible values that can be entered into a column or columns. CHECK constraints cannot be specified for CLR table-valued functions.  
  
 *logical_expression*  
 Is a logical expression that returns TRUE or FALSE.  
  
 **<computed_column_definition>::=**  
  
 Specifies a computed column. For more information about computed columns, see [CREATE TABLE &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-table-transact-sql.md).  
  
 *column_name*  
 Is the name of the computed column.  
  
 *computed_column_expression*  
 Is an expression that defines the value of a computed column.  
  
 **<index_option>::=**  
  
 Specifies the index options for the PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE index. For more information about index options, see [CREATE INDEX &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-index-transact-sql.md).  
  
 PAD_INDEX = { ON | **OFF** }  
 Specifies index padding. The default is OFF.  
  
 FILLFACTOR = *fillfactor*  
 Specifies a percentage that indicates how full the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] should make the leaf level of each index page during index creation or change. *fillfactor* must be an integer value from 1 to 100. The default is 0.  
  
 IGNORE_DUP_KEY = { ON | **OFF** }  
 Specifies the error response when an insert operation attempts to insert duplicate key values into a unique index. The IGNORE_DUP_KEY option applies only to insert operations after the index is created or rebuilt. The default is OFF.  
  
 STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = { ON | **OFF** }  
 Specifies whether distribution statistics are recomputed. The default is OFF.  
  
 ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = { **ON** | OFF }  
 Specifies whether row locks are allowed. The default is ON.  
  
 ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = { **ON** | OFF }  
 Specifies whether page locks are allowed. The default is ON.  
  
## Best Practices  
 If a user-defined function is not created with the SCHEMABINDING clause, changes that are made to underlying objects can affect the definition of the function and produce unexpected results when it is invoked. We recommend that you implement one of the following methods to ensure that the function does not become outdated because of changes to its underlying objects:  
  
-   Specify the WITH SCHEMABINDING clause when you are creating the function. This ensures that the objects referenced in the function definition cannot be modified unless the function is also modified.  
  
-   Execute the [sp_refreshsqlmodule](../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-refreshsqlmodule-transact-sql.md) stored procedure after modifying any object that is specified in the definition of the function.  
  
## Data Types  
 If parameters are specified in a CLR function, they should be [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] types as defined previously for *scalar_parameter_data_type*. For information about comparing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system data types to CLR integration data types or [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime data types, see [Mapping CLR Parameter Data](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-types-net-framework/mapping-clr-parameter-data.md).  
  
 For [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to reference the correct method when it is overloaded in a class, the method indicated in <method_specifier> must have the following characteristics:  
  
-   Receive the same number of parameters as specified in [ ,...*n* ].  
  
-   Receive all the parameters by value, not by reference.  
  
-   Use parameter types that are compatible with those specified in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] function.  
  
 If the return data type of the CLR function specifies a table type (RETURNS TABLE), the return data type of the method in <method_specifier> should be of type **IEnumerator** or **IEnumerable**, and it is assumed that the interface is implemented by the creator of the function. Unlike [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions, CLR functions cannot include PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, or CHECK constraints in <table_type_definition>. The data types of columns specified in <table_type_definition> must match the types of the corresponding columns of the result set returned by the method in <method_specifier> at execution time. This type-checking is not performed at the time the function is created.  
  
 For more information about how to program CLR functions, see [CLR User-Defined Functions](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-user-defined-functions/clr-user-defined-functions.md).  
  
## General Remarks  
 Scalar-valued functions can be invoked where scalar expressions are used. This includes computed columns and CHECK constraint definitions. Scalar-valued functions can also be executed by using the [EXECUTE](../../t-sql/language-elements/execute-transact-sql.md) statement. Scalar-valued functions must be invoked by using at least the two-part name of the function. For more information about multipart names, see [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md). Table-valued functions can be invoked where table expressions are allowed in the FROM clause of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements. For more information, see [Execute User-defined Functions](../../relational-databases/user-defined-functions/execute-user-defined-functions.md).  
  
## Interoperability  
 The following statements are valid in a function:  
  
-   Assignment statements.  
  
-   Control-of-Flow statements except TRY...CATCH statements.  
  
-   DECLARE statements defining local data variables and local cursors.  
  
-   SELECT statements that contain select lists with expressions that assign values to local variables.  
  
-   Cursor operations referencing local cursors that are declared, opened, closed, and deallocated in the function. Only FETCH statements that assign values to local variables using the INTO clause are allowed; FETCH statements that return data to the client are not allowed.  
  
-   INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements modifying local table variables.  
  
-   EXECUTE statements calling extended stored procedures.  
  
-   For more information, see [Create User-defined Functions &#40;Database Engine&#41;](../../relational-databases/user-defined-functions/create-user-defined-functions-database-engine.md).  
  
### Computed Column Interoperability  
 Functions have the following properties. The values of these properties determine whether functions can be used in computed columns that can be persisted or indexed.  
  
|Property|Description|Notes|  
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|  
|**IsDeterministic**|Function is deterministic or nondeterministic.|Local data access is allowed in deterministic functions. For example, functions that always return the same result any time they are called by using a specific set of input values and with the same state of the database would be labeled deterministic.|  
|**IsPrecise**|Function is precise or imprecise.|Imprecise functions contain operations such as floating point operations.|  
|**IsSystemVerified**|The precision and determinism properties of the function can be verified by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].||  
|**SystemDataAccess**|Function accesses system data (system catalogs or virtual system tables) in the local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].||  
|**UserDataAccess**|Function accesses user data in the local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|Includes user-defined tables and temp tables, but not table variables.|  
  
 The precision and determinism properties of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions are determined automatically by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The data access and determinism properties of CLR functions can be specified by the user. For more information, see [Overview of CLR Integration Custom Attributes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ms131098(SQL.130).aspx).  
  
 To display the current values for these properties, use [OBJECTPROPERTYEX](../../t-sql/functions/objectpropertyex-transact-sql.md).  
  
 Functions must be created with schema binding to be deterministic.  
  
 A computed column that invokes a user-defined function can be used in an index when the user-defined function has the following property values:  
  
-   **IsDeterministic** = true  
  
-   **IsSystemVerified** = true (unless the computed column is persisted)  
  
-   **UserDataAccess** = false  
  
-   **SystemDataAccess** = false  
  
 For more information, see [Indexes on Computed Columns](../../relational-databases/indexes/indexes-on-computed-columns.md).  
  
### Calling Extended Stored Procedures from Functions  
 The extended stored procedure, when it is called from inside a function, cannot return result sets to the client. Any ODS APIs that return result sets to the client will return FAIL. The extended stored procedure could connect back to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]; however, it should not try to join the same transaction as the function that invoked the extended stored procedure.  
  
 Similar to invocations from a batch or stored procedure, the extended stored procedure will be executed in the context of the Windows security account under which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running. The owner of the stored procedure should consider this when giving EXECUTE permission on it to users.  
  
## Limitations and Restrictions  
 User-defined functions cannot be used to perform actions that modify the database state.  
  
 User-defined functions cannot contain an OUTPUT INTO clause that has a table as its target.  
  
 The following [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] statements cannot be included in the definition of a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] user-defined function:  
  
-   BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION  
  
-   END CONVERSATION  
  
-   GET CONVERSATION GROUP  
  
-   MOVE CONVERSATION  
  
-   RECEIVE  
  
-   SEND  
  
 User-defined functions can be nested; that is, one user-defined function can call another. The nesting level is incremented when the called function starts execution, and decremented when the called function finishes execution. User-defined functions can be nested up to 32 levels. Exceeding the maximum levels of nesting causes the whole calling function chain to fail. Any reference to managed code from a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] user-defined function counts as one level against the 32-level nesting limit. Methods invoked from within managed code do not count against this limit.  
  
### Using Sort Order in CLR Table-valued Functions  
 When using the ORDER clause in CLR table-valued functions, follow these guidelines:  
  
-   You must ensure that results are always ordered in the specified order. If the results are not in the specified order, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will generate an error message when the query is executed.  
  
-   If an ORDER clause is specified, the output of the table-valued function must be sorted according to the collation of the column (explicit or implicit). For example, if the column collation is Chinese (either specified in the DDL for the table-valued function or obtained from the database collation), the returned results must be sorted according to Chinese sorting rules.  
  
-   The ORDER clause, if specified, is always verified by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] while returning results, whether or not it is used by the query processor to perform further optimizations. Only use the ORDER clause if you know it is useful to the query processor.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] query processor takes advantage of the ORDER clause automatically in following cases:  
  
    -   Insert queries where the ORDER clause is compatible with an index.  
  
    -   ORDER BY clauses that are compatible with the ORDER clause.  
  
    -   Aggregates, where GROUP BY is compatible with ORDER clause.  
  
    -   DISTINCT aggregates where the distinct columns are compatible with the ORDER clause.  
  
 The ORDER clause does not guarantee ordered results when a SELECT query is executed, unless ORDER BY is also specified in the query. See [sys.function_order_columns &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sys.function-order-columns-transact-sql.md) for information on how to query for columns included in the sort-order for table-valued functions.  
  
## Metadata  
 The following table lists the system catalog views that you can use to return metadata about user-defined functions.  
  
|System View|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|[sys.sql_modules](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sys.sql-modules-transact-sql.md)|See example E in the Examples section below.|  
|[sys.assembly_modules](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sys.assembly-modules-transact-sql.md)|Displays information about CLR user-defined functions.|  
|[sys.parameters](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sys.parameters-transact-sql.md)|Displays information about the parameters defined in user-defined functions.|  
|[sys.sql_expression_dependencies](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sys.sql-expression-dependencies-transact-sql.md)|Displays the underlying objects referenced by a function.|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CREATE FUNCTION permission in the database and ALTER permission on the schema in which the function is being created. If the function specifies a user-defined type, requires EXECUTE permission on the type.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using a scalar-valued user-defined function that calculates the ISO week  
 The following example creates the user-defined function `ISOweek`. This function takes a date argument and calculates the ISO week number. For this function to calculate correctly, `SET DATEFIRST 1` must be invoked before the function is called.  
  
 The example also shows using the [EXECUTE AS](../../t-sql/statements/execute-as-clause-transact-sql.md) clause to specify the security context in which a stored procedure can be executed. In the example, the option `CALLER` specifies that the procedure will be executed in the context of the user that calls it. The other options that you can specify are SELF, OWNER, and *user_name*.  
  
 Here is the function call. Notice that `DATEFIRST` is set to `1`.  
  
```  
IF OBJECT_ID (N'dbo.ISOweek', N'FN') IS NOT NULL  
    DROP FUNCTION dbo.ISOweek;  
GO  
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.ISOweek (@DATE datetime)  
RETURNS int  
WITH EXECUTE AS CALLER  
AS  
BEGIN  
     DECLARE @ISOweek int;  
     SET @ISOweek= DATEPART(wk,@DATE)+1  
          -DATEPART(wk,CAST(DATEPART(yy,@DATE) as CHAR(4))+'0104');  
--Special cases: Jan 1-3 may belong to the previous year  
     IF (@ISOweek=0)   
          SET @ISOweek=dbo.ISOweek(CAST(DATEPART(yy,@DATE)-1   
               AS CHAR(4))+'12'+ CAST(24+DATEPART(DAY,@DATE) AS CHAR(2)))+1;  
--Special case: Dec 29-31 may belong to the next year  
     IF ((DATEPART(mm,@DATE)=12) AND   
          ((DATEPART(dd,@DATE)-DATEPART(dw,@DATE))>= 28))  
          SET @ISOweek=1;  
     RETURN(@ISOweek);  
END;  
GO  
SET DATEFIRST 1;  
SELECT dbo.ISOweek(CONVERT(DATETIME,'12/26/2004',101)) AS 'ISO Week';  
  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../relational-databases/includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 `ISO Week`  
  
 `----------------`  
  
 `52`  
  
### B. Creating an inline table-valued function  
 The following example returns an inline table-valued function in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database. It returns three columns `ProductID`, `Name` and the aggregate of year-to-date totals by store as `YTD Total` for each product sold to the store.  
  
```  
IF OBJECT_ID (N'Sales.ufn_SalesByStore', N'IF') IS NOT NULL  
    DROP FUNCTION Sales.ufn_SalesByStore;  
GO  
CREATE FUNCTION Sales.ufn_SalesByStore (@storeid int)  
RETURNS TABLE  
AS  
RETURN   
(  
    SELECT P.ProductID, P.Name, SUM(SD.LineTotal) AS 'Total'  
    FROM Production.Product AS P   
    JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS SD ON SD.ProductID = P.ProductID  
    JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SH ON SH.SalesOrderID = SD.SalesOrderID  
    JOIN Sales.Customer AS C ON SH.CustomerID = C.CustomerID  
    WHERE C.StoreID = @storeid  
    GROUP BY P.ProductID, P.Name  
);  
GO  
  
```  
  
```  
SELECT * FROM Sales.ufn_SalesByStore (602);  
  
```  
  
 To invoke the function, run this query.  
  
 [!code-sql[FunctionDDL#CreateFunction3](../../t-sql/statements/codesnippet/tsql/create-function-transact_1.sql)]  
  
### C. Creating a multi-statement table-valued function  
 The following example creates the table-valued function `fn_FindReports(InEmpID)` in the AdventureWorks2012 database. When supplied with a valid employee ID, the function returns a table that corresponds to all the employees that report to the employee either directly or indirectly. The function uses a recursive common table expression (CTE) to produce the hierarchical list of employees. For more information about recursive CTEs, see [WITH common_table_expression &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/with-common-table-expression-transact-sql.md).  
  
```  
IF OBJECT_ID (N'dbo.ufn_FindReports', N'TF') IS NOT NULL  
    DROP FUNCTION dbo.ufn_FindReports;  
GO  
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.ufn_FindReports (@InEmpID INTEGER)  
RETURNS @retFindReports TABLE   
(  
    EmployeeID int primary key NOT NULL,  
    FirstName nvarchar(255) NOT NULL,  
    LastName nvarchar(255) NOT NULL,  
    JobTitle nvarchar(50) NOT NULL,  
    RecursionLevel int NOT NULL  
)  
--Returns a result set that lists all the employees who report to the   
--specific employee directly or indirectly.*/  
AS  
BEGIN  
WITH EMP_cte(EmployeeID, OrganizationNode, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, RecursionLevel) -- CTE name and columns  
    AS (  
        SELECT e.BusinessEntityID, e.OrganizationNode, p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle, 0 -- Get the initial list of Employees for Manager n  
        FROM HumanResources.Employee e   
INNER JOIN Person.Person p   
ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID  
        WHERE e.BusinessEntityID = @InEmpID  
        UNION ALL  
        SELECT e.BusinessEntityID, e.OrganizationNode, p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle, RecursionLevel + 1 -- Join recursive member to anchor  
        FROM HumanResources.Employee e   
            INNER JOIN EMP_cte  
            ON e.OrganizationNode.GetAncestor(1) = EMP_cte.OrganizationNode  
INNER JOIN Person.Person p   
ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID  
        )  
-- copy the required columns to the result of the function   
   INSERT @retFindReports  
   SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, RecursionLevel  
   FROM EMP_cte   
   RETURN  
END;  
GO  
-- Example invocation  
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, RecursionLevel  
FROM dbo.ufn_FindReports(1);   
  
GO  
```  
  
### D. Creating a CLR function  
 The example creates CLR function `len`_`s`. Before the function is created, the assembly `SurrogateStringFunction.dll` is registered in the local database.  
  
||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
```  
DECLARE @SamplesPath nvarchar(1024);  
-- You may have to modify the value of this variable if you have  
-- installed the sample in a location other than the default location.  
SELECT @SamplesPath = REPLACE(physical_name, 'Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\master.mdf', 'Microsoft SQL Server\130\Samples\Engine\Programmability\CLR\')   
    FROM master.sys.database_files   
    WHERE name = 'master';  
  
CREATE ASSEMBLY [SurrogateStringFunction]  
FROM @SamplesPath + 'StringManipulate\CS\StringManipulate\bin\debug\SurrogateStringFunction.dll'  
WITH PERMISSION_SET = EXTERNAL_ACCESS;  
GO  
  
CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[len_s] (@str nvarchar(4000))  
RETURNS bigint  
AS EXTERNAL NAME [SurrogateStringFunction].[Microsoft.Samples.SqlServer.SurrogateStringFunction].[LenS];  
GO  
```  
  
 For an example of how to create a CLR table-valued function, see [CLR Table-Valued Functions](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-user-defined-functions/clr-table-valued-functions.md).  
  
## E. Displaying the definition of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] user-defined functions
