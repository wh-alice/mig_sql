# Lesson 6: Run the RDL Schema Application (VB - C#)
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../a9retired/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] offers two methods to build and run a console application from the integrated development environment (IDE):  
  
-   Start (with Debugging)  
  
-   Start without Debugging  
  
### To build and run the SampleRDLSchema application  
  
1.  From the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**. This ensures that the console window remains open after the program has finished executing.  
  
    The application prints the following output to the console:  
  
    ```  
    Loading Report Definition  
    Updating Report Definition  
    - Old Description: <Old Report Description>  
    - New Description: <New Report Description>  
    Publishing Report Definition  
    ```  
  
2.  Press any key to close the console.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Any errors that occur are written to the console.  
  
3.  When the sample application is finished running an updated copy of the report will be saved to the report server.
