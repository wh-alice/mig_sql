# sp_publisherproperty (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Displays or changes publisher properties for non-[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Publishers. This stored procedure is executed at the Distributor.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_publisherproperty [ @publisher = ] 'publisher'   
   [ , [ @propertyname = ] 'propertyname' ]   
   [ , [ @propertyvalue = ] 'propertyvalue' ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [**@publisher** = ] **'***publisher***'**  
 Is the name of the heterogeneous Publisher. *publisher* is **sysname**, with no default.  
  
 [**@propertyname** = ] **'***propertyname***'**  
 Is the name of the property being set. *propertyname* is **sysname**, and can be one of the following values.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**xactsetbatching**|If transactions at the Publisher are grouped into transactionally consistent sets for subsequent processing, known as Xactsets. A value of **enabled** means that Xactsets can be created, which is the default. A value of **disabled** means that existing Xactsets are processed by no new Xactsets are created.|  
|**xactsetjob**|If the Xactset job is enabled for the creation of Xactsets. A value of **enabled** means that the Xactset job runs periodically to create Xactsets at the publisher. A value of **disabled** means that the Xactsets are only created by the Log Reader Agent when it polls the Publisher for changes.|  
|**xactsetjobinterval**|Interval between executions of the Xactset job, in minutes.|  
  
 When *propertyname* is omitted all settable properties are returned.  
  
 [**@propertyvalue** = ] **'***propertyvalue***'**  
 Is the new value for the property setting. *propertyvalue* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL. When *propertyvalue* is omitted, the current setting for the property is returned.  
  
## Result Sets  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**propertyname**|**sysname**|Returns the following publication properties that can be set:<br /><br /> **xactsetbatching**<br /><br /> **xactsetjob**<br /><br /> **xactsetjobinterval**|  
|**propertyvalue**|**sysname**|Is the current setting for the property in the **propertyname** column.|  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_publisherproperty** is used in transactional replication for non-[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Publishers.  
  
 When only *publisher* is specified, the result set includes the current settings for all properties that can be set.  
  
 When *propertyname* is specified, only the named property appears in the result set.  
  
 When all parameters are specified, the property is changed and a result set is not returned.  
  
 When changing the **xactsetjobinterval** property for a running job, you must restart the job for the new interval to take effect.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role at the Distributor can execute **sp_publisherproperty**.
