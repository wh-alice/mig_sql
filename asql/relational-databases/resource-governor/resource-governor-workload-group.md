# Resource Governor Workload Group
  In the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Resource Governor, a workload group serves as a container for session requests that have similar classification criteria. A workload allows for aggregate monitoring of the sessions, and defines policies for the sessions. Each workload group is in a resource pool, which represents a subset of the physical resources of an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)]. When a session is started, the Resource Governor classifier assigns the session to a specific workload group, and the session must run using the policies assigned to the workload group and the resources defined for the resource pool.  
  
## Workload Group Concepts  
 A workload group serves as a container for session requests that are similar according to the classification criteria that are applied to each request. A workload group allows the aggregate monitoring of resource consumption and the application of a uniform policy to all the requests in the group. A group defines the policies for its members.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  User-defined workload groups can be moved from one resource pool to another.  
  
 Resource Governor predefines two workload groups: the internal group and the default group. A user cannot change anything classified as an internal group, but can monitor it. Requests are classified into the default group when the following conditions exist:  
  
-   There are no criteria to classify a request.  
  
-   There is an attempt to classify the request into a non-existent group.  
  
-   There is a general classification failure.  
  
 Resource Governor also provides DDL statements for creating, changing, and dropping workload groups.
