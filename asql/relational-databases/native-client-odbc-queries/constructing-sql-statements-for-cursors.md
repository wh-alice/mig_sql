# Constructing SQL Statements for Cursors
[!INCLUDE[SNAC_Deprecated](../../a9retired/includes/snac-deprecated.md)]

  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client ODBC driver uses server cursors to implement the cursor functionality defined in the ODBC specification. An ODBC application controls the cursor behavior by using [SQLSetStmtAttr](../../relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-reference/sqlsetstmtattr.md) to set different statement attributes. These are the attributes and their defaults.  
  
|Attribute|Default|  
|---------------|-------------|  
|SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY|SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY|  
|SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE|SQL_CURSOR_FORWARD_ONLY|  
|SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_SCROLLABLE|SQL_NONSCROLLABLE|  
|SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_SENSITIVITY|SQL_UNSPECIFIED|  
|SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE|1|  
  
 When these options are set to their defaults at the time an SQL statement is executed, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client ODBC driver does not use a server cursor to implement the result set; instead, it uses a default result set. If any of these options are changed from their defaults at the time an SQL statement is executed, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client ODBC driver attempts to use a server cursor to implement the result set.  
  
 Default result sets support all of the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements. There are no restrictions on the types of SQL statements that can be executed when using a default result set.  
  
 Server cursors do not support all [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements. Server cursors do not support any SQL statement that generates multiple result sets.  
  
 The following types of statements are not supported by server cursors:  
  
-   Batches  
  
     SQL statements built from two or more individual SQL SELECT statements, for example:  
  
    ```  
    SELECT * FROM Authors; SELECT * FROM Titles  
    ```  
  
-   Stored procedures with multiple SELECT statements  
  
     SQL statements that execute a stored procedure containing more than one SELECT statement. This includes SELECT statements that fill parameters or variables.  
  
-   Keywords  
  
     SQL statements containing the keywords FOR BROWSE, or INTO.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], if an SQL statement that matches any of these conditions is executed with a server cursor, the server cursor is implicitly converted to a default result set. After **SQLExecDirect** or **SQLExecute** returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, the cursor attributes will be set back to their default settings.  
  
 SQL statements that do not fit the categories above can be executed with any statement attribute settings; they work equally well with either a default result set or a server cursor.  
  
## Errors  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 7.0 and later, an attempt to execute a statement that produces multiple result sets generates SQL_SUCCESS_WITH INFO and the following message:  
  
```  
SqlState: 01S02"  
pfNative: 0  
szErrorMsgString: "[Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client][SQL Server]  
               Cursor type changed."  
```  
  
 ODBC applications receiving this message can call [SQLGetStmtAttr](../../relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-reference/sqlgetstmtattr.md) to determine the current cursor settings.  
  
 An attempt to execute a procedure with multiple SELECT statements when using server cursors generates the following error:  
  
```  
SqlState: 42000  
pfNative: 16937  
szErrorMsgString: [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client][SQL Server]  
               A server cursor is not allowed on a stored procedure  
               with more than one SELECT statement in it. Use a  
               default result set or client cursor.  
```  
  
 An attempt to execute a batch with multiple SELECT statements when using server cursors generates the following error:  
  
```  
SqlState: 42000  
pfNative: 16938  
szErrorMsgString: [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client][SQL Server]  
               sp_cursoropen. The statement parameter can only  
               be a single SELECT statement or a single stored   
               procedure.  
```  
  
 ODBC applications receiving these errors must reset all the cursor statement attributes to their defaults before attempting to execute the statement.
