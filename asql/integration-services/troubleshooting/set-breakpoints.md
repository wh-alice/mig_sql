# Set Breakpoints
  Use the **Set Breakpoints** dialog box to specify the events on which to enable breakpoints and to control the behavior of the breakpoint.  
  
## Options  
 **Enabled**  
 Select to enable a breakpoint on an event.  
  
 **Break Condition**  
 View a list of available events on which to set breakpoints.  
  
 **Hit Count Type**  
 Specify when the breakpoint takes effect.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Always**|Execution is always suspended when the breakpoint is hit.|  
|**Hit count equals**|Execution is suspended when the number of times the breakpoint has occurred is equal to the hit count.|  
|**Hit greater or equal**|Execution is suspended when the number of times the breakpoint has occurred is equal to or greater than the hit count.|  
|**Hit count multiple**|Execution is suspended when a multiple of the hit count occurs. For example, if you set this option to 5, execution is suspended every fifth time.|  
  
 **Hit Count**  
 Specify the number of hits at which to trigger a break. This option is not available if the breakpoint is always in effect.
