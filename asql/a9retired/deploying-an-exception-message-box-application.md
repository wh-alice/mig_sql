# Deploying an Exception Message Box Application
  The exception message box is installed by [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and is supported for use in your custom Windows applications to improve exception handling. Because the exception message box is installed by all editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] except [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../a9retired/includes/ssew-md.md)], you can use it with no additional configuration on any computer on which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client components, including the SDK, have been installed.
