# sys.dm_xtp_gc_stats (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2014-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../integration-services/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2014-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Provides information (the overall statistics) about the current behavior of the [!INCLUDE[hek_2](../../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/includes/hek-2-md.md)] garbage-collection process.  
  
 Rows are garbage collected as part of regular transaction processing, or by the main garbage collection thread, which is referred to as the idle worker. When a user transaction commits, it dequeues one work item from the garbage collection queue ([sys.dm_xtp_gc_queue_stats &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-dynamic-management-views/sys.dm-xtp-gc-queue-stats-transact-sql.md)). Any rows that could be garbage collected but were not accessed by main user transaction are garbage collected by the idle worker, as part of the dusty corner scan (a scan for areas of the index that are less accessed).  
  
 For more information, see [In-Memory OLTP &#40;In-Memory Optimization&#41;](../../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/in-memory-oltp-in-memory-optimization.md).  
  
|Column name|Type|Description|  
|-----------------|----------|-----------------|  
|rows_examined|**bigint**|The number of rows examined by the garbage collection subsystem since the server was started.|  
|rows_no_sweep_needed|**bigint**|The number of rows that were removed without a dusty corner scan.|  
|rows_first_in_bucket|**bigint**|The number of rows examined by garbage collection that were the first row in the hash bucket.|  
|rows_first_in_bucket_removed|**bigint**|The number of rows examined by garbage collection that were the first row in the hash bucket that have been removed.|  
|rows_marked_for_unlink|**bigint**|The number of rows examined by garbage collection that were already marked as unlinked in their indexes with ref count =0.|  
|parallel_assist_count|**bigint**|The number of rows processed by user transactions.|  
|idle_worker_count|**bigint**|The number of garbage rows processed by the idle worker.|  
|sweep_scans_started|**bigint**|The number of dusty corner scans performed by garbage collection subsystem.|  
|sweep_scans_retries|**bigint**|The number of dusty corner scans performed by the garbage collection subsystem.|  
|sweep_rows_touched|**bigint**|Rows read by dusty corner processing.|  
|sweep_rows_expiring|**bigint**|Expiring rows read by dusty corner processing.|  
|sweep_rows_expired|**bigint**|Expired rows read by dusty corner processing.|  
|sweep_rows_expired_removed|**bigint**|Expired rows removed by dusty corner processing.|
