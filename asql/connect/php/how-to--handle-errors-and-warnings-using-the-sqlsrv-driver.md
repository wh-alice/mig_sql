# How to: Handle Errors and Warnings Using the SQLSRV Driver
![Download](../../ssdt/media/download.png)[Download PHP Driver](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=20098)

By default, the SQLSRV driver treats warnings as errors; a call to a **sqlsrv** function that generates an error or a warning will return **false**. This topic demonstrates how to turn off this default behavior and how to handle warnings separately from errors.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> There are some exceptions to the default behavior of treating warnings as errors. Warnings that correspond to the SQLSTATE values 01000, 01001, 01003, and 01S02 are never treated as errors.  
  
## Example  
The following code example uses two user-defined functions, **DisplayErrors** and **DisplayWarnings**, to handle errors and warnings. The example demonstrates how to handle warnings and errors separately by doing the following:  
  
1.  Turns off the default behavior of treating warnings as errors.  
  
2.  Creates a stored procedure that updates an employee's vacation hours and returns the remaining vacation hours as an output parameter. When an employee's available vacation hours are less than zero, the stored procedure prints a warning.  
  
3.  Updates vacation hours for several employees by calling the stored procedure for each employee, and displays the messages that correspond to any warnings and errors that occur.  
  
4.  Displays the remaining vacation hours for each employee.  
  
Note that in the first call to a **sqlsrv** function ([sqlsrv_configure](../../connect/php/sqlsrv_configure.md)), warnings are treated as errors. Because warnings are added to the error collection, you do not have to check for warnings separately from errors. In subsequent calls to **sqlsrv** functions, however, warnings will not be treated as errors, so you must check explicitly for warnings and for errors.  
  
Also note that the example code checks for errors after each call to a **sqlsrv** function. This is the recommended practice.  
  
This example assumes that SQL Server and the [AdventureWorks](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=67739) database are installed on the local computer. All output is written to the console when the example is run from the command line. When the example is run against a new installation of the AdventureWorks database, it produces three warnings and two errors. The first two warnings are standard warnings that are issued when you connect to a database. The third warning occurs because an employee's available vacation hours are updated to a value less than zero. The errors occur because an employee's available vacation hours are updated to a value less than -40 hours, which is a violation of a constraint on the table.
