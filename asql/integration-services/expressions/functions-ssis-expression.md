# Functions (SSIS Expression)
  The expression language includes a set of functions for use in expressions. An expression can use a single function, but typically an expression combines functions with operators and uses multiple functions.  
  
 The functions can be categorized into the following groups:  
  
-   Mathematical functions that perform calculations based on numeric input values provided as parameters to the functions and return numeric values.  
  
-   String functions that perform operations on string or hexadecimal input values and return a string or numeric value.  
  
-   Date and time functions that perform operations on date and time values and return string, numeric, or date and time values.  
  
-   System functions that return information about an expression.  
  
 The expression language provides the following mathematical functions.
