# sys.dm_exec_background_job_queue_stats (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns a row that provides aggregate statistics for each query processor job submitted for asynchronous (background) execution.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To call this from [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name **sys.dm_pdw_nodes_exec_background_job_queue_stats**.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**queue_max_len**|**int**|Maximum length of the queue.|  
|**enqueued_count**|**int**|Number of requests successfully posted to the queue.|  
|**started_count**|**int**|Number of requests that started execution.|  
|**ended_count**|**int**|Number of requests serviced to either success or failure.|  
|**failed_lock_count**|**int**|Number of requests that failed due to lock contention or deadlock.|  
|**failed_other_count**|**int**|Number of requests that failed due to other reasons.|  
|**failed_giveup_count**|**int**|Number of requests that failed because retry limit has been reached.|  
|**enqueue_failed_full_count**|**int**|Number of failed enqueue attempts because the queue is full.|

|**elapsed_avg_ms**|**int**|Average elapsed time of request in milliseconds.|  
|**elapsed_max_ms**|**int**|Elapsed time of the longest request in milliseconds.|  
|**pdw_node_id**|**int**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../../a9notintoc/includes/sspdw-md.md)]<br /><br /> The identifier for the node that this distribution is on.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This view returns information only for asynchronous update statistics jobs. For more information about asynchronous update statistics, see [Statistics](../../../relational-databases/statistics/statistics.md).  
  
## Permissions  
 On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] requires VIEW SERVER STATE permission on the server.  
  
 On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../a9retired/includes/sssds-md.md)] Premium Tiers requires the VIEW DATABASE STATE permission in the database. On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../a9retired/includes/sssds-md.md)] Standard and Basic Tiers requires the [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../a9retired/includes/sssds-md.md)] admin account.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Determining the percentage of failed background jobs  
 The following example returns the percentage of failed background jobs for all executed queries.  
  
```  
SELECT   
        CASE ended_count WHEN 0   
                THEN 'No jobs ended'   
                ELSE CAST((failed_lock_count + failed_giveup_count + failed_other_count) / CAST(ended_count AS float) * 100 AS varchar(20))   
        END AS [Percent Failed]  
FROM sys.dm_exec_background_job_queue_stats;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Determining the percentage of failed enqueue attempts  
 The following example returns the percentage of failed enqueue attempts for all executed queries.  
  
```  
SELECT   
        CASE enqueued_count WHEN 0   
                THEN 'No jobs posted'   
                ELSE CAST((enqueue_failed_full_count + enqueue_failed_duplicate_count) / CAST(enqueued_count AS float) * 100 AS varchar(20))   
        END AS [Percent Enqueue Failed]  
FROM sys.dm_exec_background_job_queue_stats;  
GO  
```
