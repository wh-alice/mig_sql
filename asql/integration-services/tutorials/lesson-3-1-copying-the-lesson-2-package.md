# Lesson 3-1 - Copying the Lesson 2 Package
In this task, you will create a copy of the Lesson 2.dtsx package that you created in Lesson 2. Alternatively, you can add the completed lesson 2 package that is included with the tutorial to the project, and then copy it instead. You will use this new copy throughout the rest of Lesson 3.  
  
### To create the Lesson 3 package

3.  In Solution Explorer, right-click **Lesson 2.dtsx**, and then click **Copy**.

    By default, the copied package is named Lesson 3.dtsx.  
  
5.  In Solution Explorer, double-click **Lesson 3.dtsx** to open the package.  
  
6.  Right-click anywhere in the background of the **Control Flow** tab and click **Properties**.  
  
7.  In the Properties window, update the **Name** property to **Lesson 3**.  
  
8.  Click the box for the **ID** property, and then in the list, click **<Generate New ID>**.  
  
### To add the completed Lesson2 package  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] and open the SSIS Tutorial project.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click **SSIS Packages**, and click **Add Existing Package**.  
  
3.  In the **Add Copy of Existing Package** dialog box, in **Package location**, select **File system**.  
  
4.  Click the browse **(â€¦)** button, navigate to **Lesson 2.dtsx** on your machine, and then click **Open**.  
  
    To download all of the lesson packages for this tutorial, do the following.  
  
    1.  Navigate to [Integration Services Product Samples](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=275027)  
  
    2.  Click the **DOWNLOADS** tab.  
  
    3.  Click the SQL2012.Integration_Services.Create_Simple_ETL_Tutorial.Sample.zip file.
