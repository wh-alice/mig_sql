## Options  
 **Clustered**  
 Indicates if this service is installed as a resource of a clustered server.  
  
 **Customer Feedback Reporting**

To change this value, in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Object Explorer, right-click your server, click **Properties**, and then click the **Misc. Server Settings** page. The options are presented in the **Information Reporting** area.
