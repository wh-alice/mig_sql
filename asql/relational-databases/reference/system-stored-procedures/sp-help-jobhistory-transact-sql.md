## Permissions  
 By default, members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can execute this stored procedure. Other users must be granted one of the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent fixed database roles in the **msdb** database:  
  
-   **SQLAgentUserRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentReaderRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentOperatorRole**  
  
 For details about the permissions of these roles, see [SQL Server Agent Fixed Database Roles](../Topic/SQL%20Server%20Agent%20Fixed%20Database%20Roles.md).  
  
 Members of the **SQLAgentUserRole** database role can only view the history for jobs that they own.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Listing all job information for a job  
 The following example lists all job information for the `NightlyBackups` job.  
  
```  
USE msdb ;  
GO  
  
EXEC dbo.sp_help_jobhistory   
    @job_name = N'NightlyBackups' ;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Listing information for jobs that match certain conditions  
 The following example prints all columns and all job information for any failed jobs and failed job steps with an error message of `50100` (a user-defined error message) and a severity of `20`.  
  
```  
USE msdb  
GO  
  
EXEC dbo.sp_help_jobhistory  
    @sql_message_id = 50100,  
    @sql_severity = 20,  
    @run_status = 0,  
    @mode = N'FULL' ;  
GO  
```
