# Lesson 2-1 - Visualize SQL Server Data using R
The enhanced packages in [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../../a9notintoc/includes/rsql-productname-md.md)] include multiple functions that have been optimized for scalability and parallel processing. Typically these functions are prefixed with *rx* or *Rx*.  
  
For this walkthrough, you will use the *rxHistogram* function to view the distribution of values in the _creditLine_ column by gender.  
  
## Visualize Data using rxHistogram and rxCube  
  
1.  Use the following R code to call the *rxHistogram* function and pass a formula and data source. You can run this locally at first, to see the expected results, and how long it takes.
  
    ```R  
    rxHistogram(~creditLine|gender, data = sqlFraudDS,  histType = "Percent")   
    ```  
 
    Internally, *rxHistogram* calls the *rxCube* function, which is included in the **RevoScaleR** package. The *rxCube* function outputs a single list (or data frame) containing one column for each variable specified in the formula, plus a counts column.
    
2. Now, set the compute context to the remote SQL Server computer and run the *rxHistogram* again.
  
    ```R  
    rxSetComputeContext(sqlCompute)  
    ```  
 
3.    The results are exactly the same, since you're using the same data source; however, the computations are performed on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] computer.  The results are then returned to your local workstation for plotting.  
   
![histogram results](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/media/rsql-sue-histogramresults.jpg "histogram results")  

  
4.  You can also call the *rxCube* function and pass the results to an R plotting functions.  For example, the following example uses *rxCube* to compute the mean of *fraudRisk* for every combination of *numTrans* and *numIntlTrans*:  
  
    ```R  
    cube1 <- rxCube(fraudRisk~F(numTrans):F(numIntlTrans),  data = sqlFraudDS)   
    ```  
  
    To specify the groups used to compute group means, use the `F()` notation. In this example, `F(numTrans):F(numIntlTrans)` indicates that the integers in the variables _numTrans_ and _numIntlTrans_ should be treated as categorical variables, with a level for each integer value.  
  
    Because the low and high levels were already added to the data source *sqlFraudDS* (using the *colInfo* parameter), the levels will automatically be used in the histogram.  
  
5.  The return value of *rxCube* is by default an *rxCube object*, which represents a cross-tabulation. However, you can use the *rxResultsDF* function to convert the results into a data frame that can easily be used in one of Râ€™s standard plotting functions.  
  
    ```R  
    cubePlot <- rxResultsDF(cube1)   
    ```  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    > Note that the *rxCube* function includes an optional argument, *returnDataFrame* = TRUE, that you could use to convert the results to a data frame directly. For example:  
    >   
    > `print(rxCube(fraudRisk~F(numTrans):F(numIntlTrans), data = sqlFraudDS, returnDataFrame = TRUE))`  
    >   
    > However, the output of *rxResultsDF* is much cleaner and preserves the names of the source columns.  
  
6.  Finally, run the following code to create a heat map using the *levelplot* function from the **lattice** package included with all R distributions.  
  
    ```R  
    levelplot(fraudRisk~numTrans*numIntlTrans, data = cubePlot)   
    ```  
  
    **Results**  
  
    ![scatterplot results](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/media/rsql-sue-scatterplotresults.jpg "scatterplot results")  
  
From even this quick analysis, you can see that the risk of fraud increases with both the number of transactions and the number of international transactions.
