# Relational Objects Dialog Box (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the **Relational Objects** dialog box in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to select tables, views, or other objects from a data source on which you want to set proactive caching. You can display this dialog box in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] by clicking the ellipsis button (**...**) for either of the **Specify tracking tables** options on the **Notifications** tab of the **Storage Options** dialog box.  
  
## Options  
 **Select relational objects for which you want to set proactive caching**  
 Select the objects to track. This option displays a grid of available objects and their types that match the filter set in **Filter** (or all tables if **Filter** is not set) and have not yet been shown in the current diagram.  
  
 **Filter**  
 Type the filter used to restrict the objects listed, and then click the button to filter the tables listed in **Select relational objects for which you want to set proactive caching**.  
  
 **Show system objects**  
 Select to display system objects for the data source in **Select relational objects for which you want to set proactive caching**.
