# View or Change Collection Set Schedules (SQL Server Management Studio)
  You can view or change collection set schedules by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 The collection mode, cached or non-cached, determines how you can make changes to a schedule. Cached mode uses separate schedules for collection and upload. Non-cached mode uses the same schedule for collection and upload. The type of collection mode for each of the System Datacollection sets is as follows:  
  
-   **Disk Usage** uses non-cached collection mode.  
  
-   **Query Statistics** uses cached collection mode.  
  
-   **Server Activity** uses cached collection mode.  
  
### To view collection set schedules  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, expand the **Management** node, expand **Data Collection**, and then expand **System Data Collection Sets**.  
  
2.  Right-click a collection set name, and then click **Properties** to open the [Data Collection Set Properties](#CollectionSet) dialog box.  
  
### To change the schedules for a cached mode collection set  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, expand the **Management** node, expand **Data Collection**, and then expand **System Data Collection Sets**.  
  
2.  Right-click a collection set that uses cached mode, such as **Query Statistics**, and then click **Properties** to open the [Data Collection Set Properties](#CollectionSet) dialog box.  
  
3.  You can change the collection frequency on the **General** page. To do this, follow these steps:  
  
    1.  In the details pane, double-click the number that is displayed for the **Collection Frequency (sec)** column in the **Collection items** table.  
  
    2.  To increase or decrease the collection frequency, type a lower or higher number, and then press ENTER to store the new value.  
  
4.  To change the existing upload schedule for the collection set, follow these steps:  
  
    1.  Click the **Uploads** page.  
  
    2.  In the details pane, click **Pick**.  
  
         The **Pick Schedule for Job** dialog box opens. The available schedules appear as a table.  
  
    3.  Click the row with the schedule that you want. For example, to change the schedule to every 5 minutes, click the row where the schedule name is **CollectorSchedule_Every_5min.**  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  You can view and edit the properties for the selected schedule by clicking **Properties** to open the **Job Schedule Properties** dialog box for the schedule. You can use this dialog box to change schedule information, such as the frequency.  
        >   
        >  As an alternative to modifying an existing schedule, you can create a new upload schedule by clicking **New** on the **Uploads** page. This action opens the **New Job Schedule** dialog box, which you can use to create a custom schedule.  
  
    4.  When you are finished configuring the schedule, click **OK**.  
  
         The changes that you made appear on the **Uploads** page.  
  
5.  Click **OK** to save the changes to the collection frequency and the upload schedule, and to close the **Data Collection Set Properties** dialog box.  
  
### To change the schedule for a non-cached mode collection set  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, expand the **Management** node, expand **Data Collection**, and then expand **System Data Collection Sets**.  
  
2.  Right-click a collection set that uses non-cached mode, such as **Disk Usage**, and then click **Properties** to open the [Data Collection Set Properties](#CollectionSet) dialog box.  
  
     The **Data Collection Set Properties** dialog box displays a paged view of the collection set properties.  
  
3.  To change the schedule for the collection set, click **Pick**.  
  
     The **Pick Schedule for Job** dialog box opens. The available schedules are displayed as a table.  
  
4.  Click the row with the schedule that you want. For example, to change the schedule to every 5 minutes, click the row where the schedule name is **CollectorSchedule_Every_5min**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can view and edit the properties for the selected schedule by clicking **Properties** to open the **Job Schedule Properties** dialog box for the schedule. You can use this dialog box to change schedule information, such as the frequency.  
    >   
    >  As an alternative to modifying an existing schedule, you can create a new collect and upload schedule by clicking **New** on the **General** page. This action opens the **New Job Schedule** dialog box.  
  
5.  When you are finished configuring the schedule, click **OK**.  
  
6.  Click **OK** to save the changes and to close the **Data Collection Set Properties** dialog box.
