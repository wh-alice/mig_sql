# SHUTDOWN (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Immediately stops SQL Server.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../a9notintoc/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
SHUTDOWN [ WITH NOWAIT ]   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 WITH NOWAIT  
 Optional. Shuts down [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] without performing checkpoints in every database. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] exits after attempting to terminate all user processes. When the server restarts, a rollback operation occurs for uncompleted transactions.  
  
## Remarks  
 Unless the WITHNOWAIT option is used, SHUTDOWN shuts down [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by:  
  
1.  Disabling logins (except for members of the **sysadmin** and **serveradmin** fixed server roles).  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To display a list of all current users, run **sp_who**.  
  
2.  Waiting for currently running Transact-SQL statements or stored procedures to finish. To display a list of all active processes and locks, run **sp_who** and **sp_lock**, respectively.  
  
3.  Inserting a checkpoint in every database.  
  
 Using the SHUTDOWN statement minimizes the amount of automatic recovery work needed when members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role restart [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 Other tools and methods can also be used to stop [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Each of these issues a checkpoint in all databases. You can flush committed data from the data cache and stop the server:  
  
-   By using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager.  
  
-   By running **net stop mssqlserver** from a command prompt for a default instance, or by running **net stop mssql$***instancename* from a command prompt for a named instance.  
  
-   By using Services in Control Panel.  
  
 If **sqlservr.exe** was started from the command prompt, pressing CTRL+C shuts down [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. However, pressing CTRL+C does not insert a checkpoint.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Using any of these methods to stop [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] sends the `SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP` message to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Permissions  
 SHUTDOWN permissions are assigned to members of the **sysadmin** and **serveradmin** fixed server roles, and they are not transferable.
