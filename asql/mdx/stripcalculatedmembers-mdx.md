# StripCalculatedMembers (MDX)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns a set generated by removing calculated members from a specified set.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
StripCalculatedMembers(Set_Expression)   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Set_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a set.  
  
## Remarks  
 The **StripCalculatedMembers** function removes calculated members from a set. Calculated members can be added to a set by using the [AddCalculatedMembers](../mdx/addcalculatedmembers-mdx.md) function, which returns calculated members that are defined on the server, or calculated members that were added within the query itself by using the WITH MEMBER syntax.  
  
## Example  
 The following example removes all calculated members from the query.  
  
```  
WITH MEMBER Measures.MemberName AS   
   [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2003].Properties('Name')  
MEMBER Measures.MemberVal AS   
   [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2003].Properties('Member_Value')  
MEMBER Measures.MemberKey AS   
   [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2003].Properties('Key')  
MEMBER Measures.MemberID AS   
   [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2003].Properties('ID')  
MEMBER Measures.MemberCaption AS   
   [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2003].Properties('Caption')  
MEMBER Measures.DayName AS   
   [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2003].Properties('Day Name', TYPED)  
MEMBER Measures.DayNameTyped AS   
   [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2003].Properties('Day Name')  
MEMBER Measures.DayofWeek AS   
   [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2003].Properties('Day of Week')  
MEMBER Measures.DayofMonth AS   
   [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2003].Properties('Day of Month')  
MEMBER Measures.DayofYear AS   
   [Date].[Calendar].[July 1, 2003].Properties('Day of Year')

   { Measures.DefaultMember  
   , Measures.MemberName  
   , Measures.MemberVal  
   , Measures.MemberKey  
   , Measures.MemberID  
   , Measures.MemberCaption
