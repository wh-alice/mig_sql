# Default SQL Server Network Protocol Configuration
To enhance security, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] disables network connectivity for some new installations. Network connectivity using TCP/IP is not disabled if you are using the Enterprise, Standard, or Workgroup edition or if a previous installation of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is present. For all installations, shared memory protocol is enabled to allow local connections to the server. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service might be stopped, depending on installation conditions and installation options.

Use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Network Configuration node of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager to configure the network protocols after installation. Use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Services node of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager to configure the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service to start automatically. For more information, see [Enable or Disable a Server Network Protocol](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol.md).


## Default Configuration

The following table describes the configuration after installation.

Edition	| New installation vs. previous installation is present	| Shared memory	| TCP/IP	| Named pipes
| -------- | -- | -- | -- | --  |  
Enterprise	| New installation	| Enabled	| Enabled	| Disabled for network connections.
Standard	| New installation	| Enabled	| Enabled	| Disabled for network connections.
Web	| New installation	| Enabled	| Enabled	| Disabled for network connections.
Developer	| New installation	| Enabled	| Disabled	| Disabled for network connections.
Evaluation	| New installation	| Enabled	| Disabled	| Disabled for network connections.
SQL Server Express	| New installation	| Enabled	| Disabled	| Disabled for network connections.
All editions	| Previous installation is present but is not being upgraded.	| Same as new installation	| Same as new installation	| Same as new installation
All editions	| Upgrade	| Enabled	| Settings from the previous installation are preserved.	| Settings from the previous installation are preserved.


>[!NOTE]
> If the instance is running on a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster, it will listen on those ports on each IP address selected for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] during [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setup.
 
>[!NOTE]
> When you are installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with command-prompt arguments, you can specify the protocols to enable by using the `TCPENABLED` and `NPENABLED` parameters. For more information, see [Install SQL Server from the Command Prompt](../../../database-engine/install/windows/install-sql-server-2016-from-the-command-prompt.md).

## Creating a Connection String

See the following topics for samples of connection strings:
* [Creating a Valid Connection String Using Shared Memory Protocol](../../../tools/configuration-manager/creating-a-valid-connection-string-using-shared-memory-protocol.md)
* [Creating a Valid Connection String Using TCP IP](../../../tools/configuration-manager/creating-a-valid-connection-string-using-tcp-ip.md)
* [Creating a Valid Connection String Using Named Pipes](Creating%20a%20Valid%20Connection%20String%20Using%20Named%20Pipes.xml)


## [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser Settings

The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service can be configured to start automatically during setup. The default is to start automatically under the following conditions:

* When upgrading an installation.
* When installing side-by-side with another instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
* When installing on a cluster.
* When installing a named instance of the Database Engine including all instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Express.
* When installing a named instance of Analysis Services.
