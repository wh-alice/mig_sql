# Master Data Services Add-in for Microsoft Excel
  With the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)], you can load filtered lists of data from MDS into Excel, where you can work with it just as you would any other data. When you are done, you can publish the data back to MDS, where it is centrally stored. Security determines which data you can view and update.  
  
 If you are an administrator, use the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)] to create entities and attributes and to load them with data. This eliminates the need to use any other tools to load data into your models.  
  
 In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)], you can use Data Quality Services (DQS) to match data before loading it into MDS. This helps to prevent duplicate data in MDS.

## Terms  
 When working with the Add-in, you may encounter the following terms. For more information about these concepts, see [Master Data Services Overview &#40;MDS&#41;](../../master-data-services/master-data-services-overview-mds.md).  
  
-   The *MDS repository* is where all master data is stored. It is a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database that is configured to store MDS data. To work with data from the repository, you load data it into Excel; when youâ€™re done working with it, you publish changes back to the repository. Administrators can add new entities and attributes to the repository.  
  
-   *MDS-managed data* is data that is stored in the MDS repository and that you load into Excel, where the data is displayed as highlighted rows. You can add data that is not MDS-managed to your worksheet, and it is not affected when you refresh the MDS-managed data.  
  
-   A *model* is a container of data. Versions of these containers can be created, and usually the latest version is the most recent. For more information, see [Models &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/models-master-data-services.md).  
  
-   An *entity* is a list of data. You might think of an entity as a table in a database. For example, the **Color** entity might contain a list of colors. For more information, see [Entities &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/entities-master-data-services.md).  
  
-   A *member* is a row of data (a record). Each entity contains members. An example of a member is **Blue**. For more information, see [Members &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/members-master-data-services.md).  
  
-   An *attribute* is a column of data. Each member has attributes. For example, the **Code** attribute for the **Blue** member is **B**. For more information about attributes, see [Attributes &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/attributes-master-data-services.md).
