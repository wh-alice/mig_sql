# Database Engine Developer Documentation
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides a rich set of tools for developing, administering, and controlling database applications.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Common Language Runtime &#40;CLR&#41; Integration Programming Concepts](../relational-databases/clr-integration/common-language-runtime-clr-integration-programming-concepts.md)  
 Describes the integration of the common language runtime (CLR) component of the .NET Framework for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This means that you can write stored procedures, triggers, user-defined types, user-defined functions, user-defined aggregates, and streaming table-valued functions, using any .NET Framework language, including [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual Basic .NET and [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual C#.  
  
 [SQL Server Native Client Programming](../relational-databases/native-client/sql-server-native-client-programming.md)  
 Describes how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client can be used to create new applications or enhance existing applications to take advantage of new [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features such as multiple active result sets (MARS), user-defined data types (UDT), query notifications, snapshot isolation, and XML data type support.  
  
 [SQLXML 4.0 Programming Concepts](../relational-databases/sqlxml/sqlxml-4.0-programming-concepts.md)  
 Describes the latest version of SQLXML, which delivers the same functionality as SQLXML 3.0 as well as additional updates to accommodate new features introduced in [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)], such as the xml data type.  
  
 [WMI Provider for Configuration Management Concepts](../relational-databases/wmi-provider-configuration/wmi-provider-for-configuration-management.md)  
 Describes a published layer that is used with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager snap-in for Microsoft Management Console (MMC) and the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager. It provides a unified way for interfacing with the API calls that manage the registry operations requested by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager and provides enhanced control and manipulation over the selected [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services.  
  
 [WMI Provider for Server Events Concepts](../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/wmi-provider-for-server-events-concepts.md)  
 Describes how to use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to monitor events in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 [SQL Server Management Objects &#40;SMO&#41; Programming Guide](../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/sql-server-management-objects-smo-programming-guide.md)  
 Contains information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO), a collection of objects that are designed for programming all aspects of managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 [Database Engine Extended Stored Procedure Programming](../relational-databases/database-engine-extended-stored-procedure-programming.md)  
 Describes how to use extended stored procedures to create your own external routines in a programming language such as C.  
  
 [Data Collector Programming](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/bb677200(SQL.130).aspx)  
 Describes the Data Collector object model.  
  
 [Exception Message Box Programming](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ms166343(SQL.130).aspx)  
 Describes how you can use the exception message box programmatic interface in your applications to provide more control over the messaging experience, to give your users the option to save error message content for later reference, and to get help with messages.
