# Partial Backups (SQL Server)
  All [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] recovery models support partial backups, so this topic is relevant for all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases. However, partial backups are designed for use under the simple recovery model to improve flexibility for backing up very large databases that contain one or more read-only filegroups.  
  
 Partial backups are useful whenever you want to exclude read-only filegroups. A *partial backup* resembles a full database backup, but a partial backup does not contain all the filegroups. Instead, for a read-write database, a partial backup contains the data in the primary filegroup, every read-write filegroup, and, optionally, one or more read-only files. A partial backup of a read-only database contains only the primary filegroup.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If a read-only database is changed to read/write after a partial backup, there might be read/write secondary filegroups that are not in the partial backup. In this case, if you try to take a differential partial backup, the backup fails. Before you can take a differential partial backup of the database, you must take another partial backup. The new partial backup contains every read/write secondary filegroup and can serve as the base for differential partial backups.  
  
 File backups of read-only filegroups can be combined with partial backups. For information about file backups, see [Full File Backups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/full-file-backups-sql-server.md).  
  
 A partial backup can serve as the *differential base* for differential partial backups. For more information, see [Differential Backups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/differential-backups-sql-server.md).
