|**p2p_continue_onconflict**|**true**|The Distribution Agent continues to process changes when a conflict is detected.<br /><br /> **\*\* Caution \*\*** We recommend that you use the default value of FALSE. When this option is set to TRUE, the Distribution Agent tries to converge data in the topology by applying the conflicting row from the node that has the highest originator ID. This method does not guarantee convergence. You should make sure that the topology is consistent after a conflict is detected. For more information, see "Handling Conflicts" in [Conflict Detection in Peer-to-Peer Replication](../Topic/Conflict%20Detection%20in%20Peer-to-Peer%20Replication.md).|

You can no longer add publication information to the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Active Directory.|  
||**false**|Removes the publication information from Active Directory.|  
|**queue_type**|**sql**|Use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to store transactions. This property can be changed only if there are no active subscriptions.<br /><br /> Note: Support for using [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Message Queuing has been discontinued.

||**false**|Snapshot files are stored in the alternate location specified by *alt_snapshot_folder*.|  
|**status**|**active**|Publication data is available for Subscribers immediately when the publication is created. Not supported for Oracle Publishers.|  
||**inactive**|Publication data are not available for Subscribers when the publication is created. Not supported for Oracle Publishers.|  
|**sync_method**|**native**|Uses native-mode bulk copy output of all tables when synchronizing subscriptions.|  
||**character**|Uses character-mode bulk copy output of all tables when synchronizing subscriptions.|

Additional reference: [KB 3170123](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3170123/supports-drop-table-ddl-for-articles-that-are-included-in-transactional-replication-in-sql-server-2014-or-in-sql-server-2016-sp1)|
||**false**|Disables DROP TABLE DLL support for articles which are part of Transactional Replication. This is the **default** value for this property.|
|NULL (default)||Returns the list of supported values for *property*.|  
  
 [ **@force_invalidate_snapshot =** ] *force_invalidate_snapshot*  
 Acknowledges that the action taken by this stored procedure may invalidate an existing snapshot. *force_invalidate_snapshot* is a **bit**, with a default of **0**.  
  
 **0** specifies that changes to the article do not cause the snapshot to be invalid. If the stored procedure detects that the change does require a new snapshot, an error occurs and no changes are made.  
  
 **1** specifies that changes to the article may cause the snapshot to be invalid. If there are existing subscriptions that would require a new snapshot, this value gives permission for the existing snapshot to be marked as obsolete and a new snapshot generated.  
  
 See the Remarks section for the properties that, when changed, require the generation of a new snapshot.  
  
 [**@force_reinit_subscription =** ] *force_reinit_subscription*  
 Acknowledges that the action taken by this stored procedure may require existing subscriptions to be reinitialized. *force_reinit_subscription* is a **bit** with a default of **0**.  
  
 **0** specifies that changes to the article do not cause the subscription to be reinitialized. If the stored procedure detects that the change would require existing subscriptions to be reinitialized, an error occurs and no changes are made.  
  
 **1** specifies that changes to the article cause the existing subscription to be reinitialized, and gives permission for the subscription reinitialization to occur.  
  
 [ **@publisher** = ] **'***publisher***'**  
 Specifies a non-[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Publisher. *publisher* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  *publisher* should not be used when changing article properties on a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Publisher.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_changepublication** is used in snapshot replication and transactional replication.  
  
 Changing any of the following properties requires that a new snapshot be generated, and you must specify a value of **1** for the *force_invalidate_snapshot* parameter.  
  
-   **alt_snapshot_folder**  
  
-   **compress_snapshot**  
  
-   **enabled_for_het_sub**  
  
-   **ftp_address**  
  
-   **ftp_login**  
  
-   **ftp_password**  
  
-   **ftp_port**  
  
-   **ftp_subdirectory**  
  
-   **post_snapshot_script**  
  
-   **pre_snapshot_script**  
  
-   **snapshot_in_defaultfolder**  
  
-   **sync_mode**  
  
 To list publication objects in the Active Directory using the **publish_to_active_directory** parameter, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] object must already be created in the Active Directory.  
  
## Impact of immediate sync  
 When immediate sync is on, all changes in the log are tracked immediately after the initial snapshot is generated even if there are no subscriptions. Logged changes will be used when a customer is using backup to add a new peer node. After the backup is restored, the peer will be synched with any other changes occurring after the backup was taken. Since the commands are tracked in the distribution database, the synchronization logic can look at the last backed up LSN and use this as a starting point, knowing that the command will be available if the backup was taken within the max retention period. (The default values for the min retention period is 0 hrs and max retention period is 24 hrs.)  
  
 When immediate sync is off, changes are kept at least the min retention period and cleaned up immediately for all the transactions that are already replicated. If immediate sync is off and configured with the default retention period, it is likely that the required changes after the backup was taken were cleaned up and the new peer node will not be initialized properly. The only option left is to quiesce the topology. Setting immediate sync to on provides greater flexibility and is the recommended setting for P2P replication.
