# Delete a Derived Hierarchy (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], delete a derived hierarchy when you are sure you no longer need it.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Deleting a derived hierarchy has no effect on the attribute relationships that the hierarchy is based on.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To delete a derived hierarchy  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../database-engine/install/windows/includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **System Administration**.  
  
2.  From the menu bar, point to **Manage** and click **Derived Hierarchies**.  
  
3.  On the **Derived Hierarchy Maintenance** page, from the **Model** list, select a model.
