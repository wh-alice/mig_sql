# OLEDB Call Event Class
  The **OLEDB Call** event class occurs when [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] calls an OLE DB provider for distributed queries and remote stored procedures.  
  
 Include the **OLEDB Call** event class in traces to monitor only those calls that do not request data or calls that are not made to the **QueryInterface** method. When the **OLEDB Call** event class is included in a trace the amount of overhead incurred depends on how frequently OLE DB calls occur against the database during the trace. If calls occur frequently, the trace may significantly impede performance.  
  
## OLEDB Call Event Class Data Columns  
  
|Data column name|Data type|Description|Column ID|Filterable|  
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|  
|ApplicationName|**nvarchar**|Name of the client application that created the connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This column is populated with the values passed by the application rather than the displayed name of the program.|10|Yes|  
|ClientProcessID|**Int**|ID assigned by the host computer to the process where the client application is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the client process ID.|9|Yes|  
|DatabaseID|**Int**|ID of the database specified by the USE *database* statement or the default database if no USE *database* statement has been issued for a given instance. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the **ServerName** data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|  
|DatabaseName|**nvarchar**|Name of the database in which the user statement is running.|35|Yes|  
|Duration|**Bigint**|Length of time to complete the OLE DB Call event.|13|No|  
|EndTime|**Datetime**|Time that the event ended.|15|Yes|  
|Error|**int**|Error number of a given event. Often this is the error number stored in the sys.messages catalog view.|31|Yes|  
|EventClass|**Int**|Type of event = 119.|27|No|  
|EventSequence|**Int**|Sequence of OLE DB event class in batch.|51|No|  
|EventSubClass|**Int**|0=Starting<br /><br /> 1=Completed|21|No|  
|GroupID|**int**|ID of the workload group where the SQL Trace event fires.|66|Yes|  
|HostName|**nvarchar**|Name of the computer on which the client is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the host name. To determine the host name, use the HOST_NAME function.|8|Yes|  
|IsSystem|**int**|Indicates whether the event occurred on a system process or a user process. 1 = system, 0 = user.|60|Yes|  
|LinkedServerName|**nvarchar**|Name of the linked server.|45|Yes|  
|LoginName|**nvarchar**|Name of the login of the user (either [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security login or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows login credentials in the form of DOMAIN\Username).|11|Yes|  
|LoginSid|**Image**|Security identifier (SID) of the logged-in user. You can find this information in the sys.server_principals catalog view. Each SID is unique for each login in the server.|41|Yes|  
|MethodName|**nvarchar**|Name of the OLE DB method.|47|Yes|  
|NTDomainName|**nvarchar**|Windows domain to which the user belongs.|7|Yes|  
|NTUserName|**nvarchar**|Windows user name.|6|Yes|  
|ProviderName|**nvarchar**|Name of the OLE DB provider.|46|Yes|  
|RequestID|**Int**|ID of the request containing the statement.|49|Yes|  
|SessionLoginName|**nvarchar**|Login name of the user who originated the session. For example, if you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using Login1 and execute a statement as Login2, **SessionLoginName** shows Login1 and **LoginName** shows Login2. This column displays both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows logins.|64|Yes|  
|SPID|**Int**|ID of the session on which the event occurred.|12|Yes|  
|StartTime|**datetime**|Time at which the event started, if available.|14|Yes|  
|TextData|**nvarchar**|Parameters sent and received in the OLE DB call.|1|No|  
|TransactionID|**bigint**|System-assigned ID of the transaction.|4|Yes|
