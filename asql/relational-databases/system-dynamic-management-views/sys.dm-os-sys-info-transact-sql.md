Not nullable.|  
|**physical_memory_kb**|**bigint**|**Applies to: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)]**.<br /><br /> Specifies the total amount of physical memory on the machine. Not nullable.|  
|**virtual_memory_in_bytes**|**bigint**|**Applies to: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)]**.<br /><br /> Amount of virtual memory available to the process in user mode.

When not using the Address Windowing Extensions (AWE), when the buffer pool has obtained its memory target (bpool_committed = bpool_commit_target), the value of bpool_visible equals the value of bpool_committed.When using AWE on a 32-bit version of SQL Server, bpool_visible represents the size of the AWE mapping window used to access physical memory allocated by the buffer pool. The size of this mapping window is bound by the process address space and, therefore, the visible amount will be smaller than the committed amount, and can be further reduced by internal components consuming memory for purposes other than database pages. If the value of bpool_visible is too low, you might receive out of memory errors.|
