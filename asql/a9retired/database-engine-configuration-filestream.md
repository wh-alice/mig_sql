# Database Engine Configuration - Filestream
  Use this page to enable FILESTREAM for this installation of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. FILESTREAM integrates the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] with an NTFS file system by storing **varbinary(max)** binary large object (BLOB) data as files on the file system. [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements can insert, update, query, search, and back up FILESTREAM data. Win32 file system interfaces provide streaming access to the data.  
  
## UIElement List  
 **Enable FILESTREAM for Transact-SQL access**  
 Select to enable FILESTREAM for [!INCLUDE[tsql](../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] access. This control must be checked before the other control options will be available.
