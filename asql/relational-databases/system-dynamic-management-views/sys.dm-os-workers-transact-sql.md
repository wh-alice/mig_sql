  Returns a row for every worker in the system.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To call this from [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name **sys.dm_pdw_nodes_os_workers**.

## Remarks  
 If the worker state is RUNNING and the worker is running nonpreemptively, the worker address matches the active_worker_address in sys.dm_os_schedulers.  
  
 When a worker that is waiting on an event is signaled, the worker is placed at the head of the runnable queue. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] allows for this to happen one thousand times in a row, after which the worker is placed at the end of the queue. Moving a worker to the end of the queue has some performance implications.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires VIEW SERVER STATE permission on the server.  
  
## Examples  
 You can use the following query to find out how long a worker has been running in a SUSPENDED or RUNNABLE state.  
  
```  
SELECT   
    t1.session_id,  
    CONVERT(varchar(10), t1.status) AS status,  
    CONVERT(varchar(15), t1.command) AS command,  
    CONVERT(varchar(10), t2.state) AS worker_state,  
    w_suspended =   
      CASE t2.wait_started_ms_ticks  
        WHEN 0 THEN 0  
        ELSE   
          t3.ms_ticks - t2.wait_started_ms_ticks  
      END,  
    w_runnable =   
      CASE t2.wait_resumed_ms_ticks  
        WHEN 0 THEN 0  
        ELSE   
          t3.ms_ticks - t2.wait_resumed_ms_ticks  
      END  
  FROM sys.dm_exec_requests AS t1  
  INNER JOIN sys.dm_os_workers AS t2  
    ON t2.task_address = t1.task_address  
  CROSS JOIN sys.dm_os_sys_info AS t3  
  WHERE t1.scheduler_id IS NOT NULL;  
```

 `session_id status     command         worker_state w_suspended w_runnable`  
  
 `---------- ---------- --------------- ------------ ----------- --------------------`  
  
 `4          background LAZY WRITER     SUSPENDED    688         688`  
  
 `6          background LOCK MONITOR    SUSPENDED    4657        4657`

 `14         background BRKR EVENT HNDL SUSPENDED    63583641    63583641`  
  
 `51         running    SELECT          RUNNING      0           0`  
  
 `2          background RESOURCE MONITO RUNNING      0           603825954`  
  
 `3          background LAZY WRITER     SUSPENDED    422         422`  
  
 `7          background SIGNAL HANDLER  SUSPENDED    603820485   603820485`  
  
 `13         background TASK MANAGER    SUSPENDED    603824704   603824704`  
  
 `18         background BRKR TASK       SUSPENDED    603820407   603820407`  
  
 `9          background TRACE QUEUE TAS SUSPENDED    454         454`  
  
 `52         suspended  SELECT          SUSPENDED    35094       35094`  
  
 `1          background RESOURCE MONITO RUNNING      0           603825954`  
  
 In the output, when `w_runnable` and `w_suspended` are equal, this represents the time that the worker is in the SUSPENDED state. Otherwise, `w_runnable` represents the time that is spent by the worker in the RUNNABLE state. In the output, session `52` is `SUSPENDED` for `35,094` milliseconds.
