# CREATE RESOURCE POOL (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Creates a Resource Governor resource pool in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. A resource pool represents a subset of the physical resources (memory, CPUs and IO) of an instance of the Database Engine. Resource Governor enables a database administrator to distribute server resources among resource pools, up to a maximum of 64 pools. Resource Governor is not available in every edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For a list of features that are supported by the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2016](../Topic/Features%20Supported%20by%20the%20Editions%20of%20SQL%20Server%202016.md).

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
CREATE RESOURCE POOL pool_name  
[ WITH  
    (  
        [ MIN_CPU_PERCENT = value ]  
        [ [ , ] MAX_CPU_PERCENT = value ]   
        [ [ , ] CAP_CPU_PERCENT = value ]   
        [ [ , ] AFFINITY {SCHEDULER =  
                  AUTO | ( <scheduler_range_spec> )   
                | NUMANODE = ( <NUMA_node_range_spec> )} ]   
        [ [ , ] MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT = value ]  
        [ [ , ] MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = value ]  
        [ [ , ] MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = value ]  
        [ [ , ] MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = value ]  
    )   
]  
[;]  
  
<scheduler_range_spec> ::=  
{ SCHED_ID | SCHED_ID TO SCHED_ID }[,…n]  
  
<NUMA_node_range_spec> ::=  
{ NUMA_node_ID | NUMA_node_ID TO NUMA_node_ID }[,…n]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *pool_name*  
 Is the user-defined name for the resource pool. *pool_name* is alphanumeric, can be up to 128 characters, must be unique within an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and must comply with the rules for [identifiers](../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md).  
  
 MIN_CPU_PERCENT =*value*  
 Specifies the guaranteed average CPU bandwidth for all requests in the resource pool when there is CPU contention. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 0. The allowed range for *value* is from 0 through 100.  
  
 MAX_CPU_PERCENT =*value*  
 Specifies the maximum average CPU bandwidth that all requests in resource pool will receive when there is CPU contention. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 100. The allowed range for *value* is from 1 through 100.  
  
 CAP_CPU_PERCENT =*value*  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Specifies a hard cap on the CPU bandwidth that all requests in the resource pool will receive. Limits the maximum CPU bandwidth level to be the same as the specified value. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 100. The allowed range for *value* is from 1 through 100.  
  
 AFFINITY {SCHEDULER = AUTO | ( <scheduler_range_spec> ) | NUMANODE = (<NUMA_node_range_spec>)}  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Attach the resource pool to specific schedulers. The default value is AUTO.  
  
 AFFINITY SCHEDULER = **(** <scheduler_range_spec> **)** maps the resource pool to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] schedules identified by the given IDs. These IDs map to the values in the scheduler_id column in [sys.dm_os_schedulers &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys.dm-os-schedulers-transact-sql.md).  
  
 When you use AFFINITY NUMANODE = **(** <NUMA_node_range_spec> **)**, the resource pool is affinitized to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] schedulers that map to the physical CPUs that correspond to the given NUMA node or range of nodes. You can use the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] query to discover the mapping between the physical NUMA configuration and the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] scheduler IDs.  
  
```  
SELECT osn.memory_node_id AS [numa_node_id], sc.cpu_id, sc.scheduler_id  
FROM sys.dm_os_nodes AS osn  
INNER JOIN sys.dm_os_schedulers AS sc   
    ON osn.node_id = sc.parent_node_id   
    AND sc.scheduler_id < 1048576;  
  
```  
  
 MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT =*value*  
 Specifies the minimum amount of memory reserved for this resource pool that can not be shared with other resource pools. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 0 The allowed range for *value* is from 0 to 100.  
  
 MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT =*value*  
 Specifies the total server memory that can be used by requests in this resource pool. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 100. The allowed range for *value* is from 1 through 100.  
  
 MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME =*value*  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Specifies the minimum I/O operations per second (IOPS) per disk volume to reserve for the resource pool. The allowed range for *value* is from 0 through 2^31-1 (2,147,483,647). Specify 0 to indicate no minimum threshold for the pool. The default is 0.  
  
 MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME =*value*  
 ||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
 Specifies the maximum I/O operations per second (IOPS) per disk volume to allow for the resource pool. The allowed range for *value* is from 0 through 2^31-1 (2,147,483,647). Specify 0 to set an unlimited threshold for the pool. The default is 0.  
  
 If the MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME for a pool is set to 0, the pool is not governed at all and can take all the IOPS in the system even if other pools have MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME set. For this case, we recommend that you set the MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME value for this pool to a high number (for example, the maximum value 2^31-1) if you want this pool to be governed for IO.  
  
## Remarks  
 MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME and MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME specify the minimum and maximum reads or writes per second. These reads or writes can be of any size and do not indicate minimum or maximum throughput.  
  
 The values for MAX_CPU_PERCENT and MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT must be greater than or equal to the values for MIN_CPU_PERCENT and MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT, respectively.  
  
 CAP_CPU_PERCENT differs from MAX_CPU_PERCENT in that workloads associated with the pool can use CPU capacity above the value of MAX_CPU_PERCENT if it is available, but not above the value of CAP_CPU_PERCENT.  
  
 The total CPU percentage for each affinitized component (scheduler(s) or NUMA node(s)) should not exceed 100%.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL SERVER permission.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows how to create a resource pool named `bigPool`. This pool uses the default Resource Governor settings.  
  
```  
CREATE RESOURCE POOL bigPool;  
GO  
ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;  
GO  
```  
  
 The following example sets the `CAP_CPU_PERCENT` to a hard cap of 30% and sets `AFFINITY SCHEDULER` to a range of 0 to 63, 128 to 191.  
  
||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
```  
CREATE RESOURCE POOL PoolAdmin  
WITH (  
     MIN_CPU_PERCENT = 10,  
     MAX_CPU_PERCENT = 20,  
     CAP_CPU_PERCENT = 30,  
     AFFINITY SCHEDULER = (0 TO 63, 128 TO 191),  
     MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT = 5,  
     MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = 15  
      );  
  
```  
  
 The following example sets `MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME` to \<some value> and `MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME` to \<some value>. These values govern the physical I/O read and write operations that are available for the resource pool.  
  
||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../analysis-services/includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].|  
  
```  
CREATE RESOURCE POOL PoolAdmin  
WITH (  
    MIN_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = 20,  
    MAX_IOPS_PER_VOLUME = 100  
      );  
  
```
