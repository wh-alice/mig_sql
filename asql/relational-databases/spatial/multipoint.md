# MultiPoint
  A **MultiPoint** is a collection of zero or more points. The boundary of a **MultiPoint** instance is empty.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates a `geometry MultiPoint` instance with SRID 23 and two points: one point with the coordinates (2, 3), one point with the coordinates (7, 8), and a Z value of 9.5.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geometry;  
SET @g = geometry::STGeomFromText('MULTIPOINT((2 3), (7 8 9.5))', 23);  
```  
  
 This `MultiPoint` instance can also be expressed using `STMPointFromText()` as shown below.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geometry;  
SET @g = geometry::STMPointFromText('MULTIPOINT((2 3), (7 8 9.5))', 23);  
```  
  
 The following example uses the method `STGeometryN()` to retrieve a description of the first point in the collection.  
  
```  
SELECT @g.STGeometryN(1).STAsText();  
```
