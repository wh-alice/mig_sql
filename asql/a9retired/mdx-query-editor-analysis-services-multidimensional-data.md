# MDX Query Editor (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the MDX Query Editor to design and execute statements and scripts written in the Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) language.  
  
## Features  
  
-   Type scripts in the query editor pane of MDX Query Editor.  
  
-   To execute scripts press **F5**, or click **Execute** on the toolbar, or on the **Query** menu, click **Execute**. If a portion of the code is selected, only that portion is executed. If no code is selected, the entire content of the MDX Query Editor is executed.  
  
-   View metadata for cubes and other objects contained in an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database in the metadata pane.  
  
-   For help on MDX syntax, select a keyword in MDX Query Editor, and then click **F1**.  
  
-   For dynamic help with MDX syntax, on the **Help** menu, click **Dynamic Help**, to open the Dynamic Help component. With Dynamic Help, help topics appear in the **Dynamic Help** window when keywords are typed in Query Editor.  
  
## SQL Server Analysis Services Editors Toolbar  
 When MDX Query Editor is open, the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Editors toolbar appears with the buttons listed in the following table.  
  
|Term|Definition|

|**Disconnect**|Disconnects the MDX Query Editor from an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance.|  
|**Change Connection**|Opens the **Connect to Server** dialog box, to establish a connection to a different [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance.|  
|**New Query with Current Connection**|Opens a new MDX Query Editor window, using the connection information from the current MDX Query Editor window.|  
|**Available Databases**|Change the connection to a different [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database on the same instance.|  
|**Execute**|Executes the selected code, or if no code is selected, executes the entire code in the MDX Query Editor.|  
|**Parse**|Checks the syntax of the selected code. If no code is selected, checks the syntax of the entire MDX Query Editor window.|  
|**Cancel Executing Query**|Sends a cancellation request to the server. Some queries cannot be canceled immediately, but must wait for a suitable cancellation condition. When queries are canceled, delays may occur while transactions are rolled back.|
