# Setting the Connection Properties
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../connect/jdbc/includes)]

  The connection string properties can be specified in various ways:  
  
-   As name=value properties in the connection URL when you connect by using the DriverManager class.  
  
-   As name=value properties in the *Properties* parameter of the Connect method in the DriverManager class.  
  
-   As values in the appropriate setter method of the data source of the driver. For example:  
  
    ```  
  
    datasource.setServerName(value)  
    datasource.setDatabaseName(value)  
  
    ```  
  
## Remarks  
 Property names are case-insensitive, and duplicate property names are resolved in the following order:  
  
1.  API arguments (such as user and password)  
  
2.  Property collection.  
  
3.  Last instance in the connection string.  
  
 In addition, unknown values are allowed for the property names, and their values are not validated by the JDBC driver for case sensitivity.  
  
 Synonyms are allowed and are resolved in order, just as duplicate property names.  
  
 The following table lists all the currently available connection string properties for the JDBC driver.  
  
|Property|Type|Default|Description|  
|--------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|  
|accessToken|String|null|Use this property to connect to a SQL database using an access token. **accessToken** can only be set using the Properties parameter of the Connect method in the DriverManager class. It cannot be used in the connection URL.|  
|applicationIntent|String|**ReadWrite**|Declares the application workload type when connecting to a server. Possible values are **ReadOnly** and **ReadWrite**. For more information, see [JDBC Driver Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](../../connect/jdbc/jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability--disaster-recovery.md).|  
|applicationName|String<br /><br /> [<=128 char]|null|The application name, or "Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server" if no name is provided. Used to identify the specific application in various SQL Server profiling and logging tools.|  
|authentication|String|NotSpecified|Beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server, this optional property indicates which SQL authentication method to use for connection. Possible values are **ActiveDirectoryIntegrated**, **ActiveDirectoryPassword**, **SqlPassword** and the default **NotSpecified**.<br /><br /> Use **ActiveDirectoryIntegrated** to connect to a SQL Database using integrated Windows authentication.<br /><br /> Use **ActiveDirectoryPassword** to connect to a SQL Database using an Azure AD principal name and password.<br /><br /> Use **SqlPassword** to connect to a SQL Server using **userName**/**user** and **password** properties.<br /><br /> Use **NotSpecified** if none of these authentication methods is needed.<br /><br /> **Important:**  If authentication is set to ActiveDirectoryIntegrated, the following two libraries will need to be installed: `SQLJDBC_AUTH.DLL (available in the JDBC driver package)` and `Azure Active Directory Authentication Library for SQL Server (ADALSQL.DLL)` It is available in multiple languages (both x86 and amd64) from the download center at [Microsoft Active Directory Authentication Library for Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48742). The JDBC driver only supports version **1.0.2028.318 and higher** for the ADALSQL.DLL.<br /><br /> **Note:**  When authentication property is set to any value other than **NotSpecified**, the driver by default uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption.<br /><br /> For information on how to configure Azure Active Directory authentication visit [Connecting to SQL Database By Using Azure Active Directory Authentication](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-aad-authentication/).|  
|authenticationScheme|String|"NativeAuthentication"|Indicates which kind of integrated security you want your application to use. Possible values are **JavaKerberos** and the default **NativeAuthentication**.<br /><br /> When using **authenticationScheme=JavaKerberos**, you must specify the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) in the **serverName** or **serverSpn** property. Otherwise, an error will occur (Server not found in Kerberos database).<br /><br /> For more information on using **authenticationScheme**, see [Using Kerberos Integrated Authentication to Connect to SQL Server](../../connect/jdbc/using-kerberos-integrated-authentication-to-connect-to-sql-server.md).|  
|columnEncryptionSetting|String<br /><br /> ["Enabled"&#124;"Disabled"]|Disabled|Set to "Enabled" to use the Always Encrypted (AE) feature beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server. When AE is enabled, the JDBC driver transparently encrypts and decrypts sensitive data stored in encrypted database columns in the SQL Server.<br /><br /> See [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC Driver](../Topic/Using%20Always%20Encrypted%20with%20the%20JDBC%20Driver.md) for more details.<br /><br /> **Note:**  Always Encrypted is available with SQL Server 2016 or later versions.|  
|databaseName, database|String<br /><br /> [<=128 char]|null|The name of the database to connect to. If not stated, a connection is made to the default database.|  
|disableStatementPooling|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|true|Only the value "true" is currently supported. If set to "false", an exception will occur.|  
|encrypt|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|false|Set to "true" to specify that the SQL Server uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for all the data sent between the client and the server if the server has a certificate installed. The default value is false.<br /><br /> Beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server, there is a new connection setting ‘authentication’ that uses SSL encryption by default. For more information see the ‘authentication’ property.|  
|failoverPartner|String|null|The name of the failover server used in a database mirroring configuration. This property is used for an initial connection failure to the principal server; after you make the initial connection, this property is ignored. Must be used in conjunction with databaseName property.<br /><br /> **Note:**  The driver does not support specifying the server instance port number for the failover partner instance as part of the failoverPartner property in the connection string. However, specifying the serverName, instanceName and portNumber properties of the principal server instance and failoverPartner property of the failover partner instance in the same connection string is supported.<br /><br /> If you specify a Virtual Network Name in the **Server** connection property, you cannot use database mirroring. See [JDBC Driver Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](../../connect/jdbc/jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability--disaster-recovery.md) for more information.|  
|hostNameInCertificate|String|null|The host name to be used in validating the SQL Server SSL certificate.<br /><br /> If the hostNameInCertificate property is unspecified or set to null, the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server will use the **serverName** property value on the connection URL as the host name to validate the SQL Server SSL certificate.<br /><br /> **Note:**  This property is used in combination with the **encrypt**/**authentication** properties and the **trustServerCertificate** property. This property affects the certificate validation, if and only if the connection uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption and the **trustServerCertificate** is set to "false". Make sure the value passed to **hostNameInCertificate** exactly matches the Common Name (CN) or DNS name in the Subject Alternate Name (SAN) in the server certificate for an SSL connection to succeed. For more information, see [Understanding SSL Support](../../connect/jdbc/understanding-ssl-support.md).|  
|instanceName|String<br /><br /> [<=128 char]|null|The SQL Server instance name to connect to. When it is not specified, a connection is made to the default instance. For the case where both the instanceName and port are specified, see the notes for port.<br /><br /> If you specify a Virtual Network Name in the **Server** connection property, you cannot use **instanceName** connection property. See [JDBC Driver Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](../../connect/jdbc/jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability--disaster-recovery.md) for more information.|  
|integratedSecurity|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|false|Set to "true" to indicate that Windows credentials will be used by SQL Server to authenticate the user of the application. If "true," the JDBC driver searches the local computer credential cache for credentials that have already been provided at the computer or network logon. If "false," the username and password must be supplied.<br /><br /> **Note:**  This connection property is only supported on Microsoft Windows operating systems.|  
|keyStoreAuthentication|String|null| Beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server, this property identifies which key store to seamlessly set up for the connection with Always Encrypted and determines an authentication mechanism used to authenticate to the key store. Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server supports setting up of the Java Key Store seamlessly using this property for which you need to set "**keyStoreAuthentication=JavaKeyStorePassword**". Note that to use this property, you also need to set the **keyStoreLocation** and **keyStoreSecret** properties for the Java Key Store. <br/><br/>For more information, visit [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC Driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt591987%28v=sql.110%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396). 
|keyStoreLocation|String|null|When **keyStoreAuthentication=JavaKeyStorePassword**, the **keyStoreLocation** property identifies the path to the Java keystore file that stores the column master key to be used with Always Encrypted data. Note that the path must include the keystore filename.<br/><br/>For more information, visit [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC Driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt591987%28v=sql.110%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396).
|keyStoreSecret|String|null|When **keyStoreAuthentication=JavaKeyStorePassword**, the **keyStoreSecret** property identifies the password to use for the keystore as well as for the key. Note that for using the Java Key Store the keystore and the key password must be the same.<br/><br/>For more information, visit [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC Driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt591987%28v=sql.110%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396).
|lastUpdateCount|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|true|A "true" value only returns the last update count from an SQL statement passed to the server, and it can be used on single SELECT, INSERT, or DELETE statements to ignore additional update counts caused by server triggers. Setting this property to "false" causes all update counts to be returned, including those returned by server triggers.<br /><br /> **Note:**  This property only applies when it is used with the [executeUpdate](../../connect/jdbc/reference/executeupdate-method--sqlserverstatement-.md) methods. All other execute methods return all results and update counts. This property only affects update counts returned by server triggers. It does not affect result sets or errors that result as part of trigger execution.|  
|lockTimeout|int|-1|The number of milliseconds to wait before the database reports a lock time-out. The default behavior is to wait indefinitely. If it is specified, this value is the default for all statements on the connection. Note that `Statement.setQueryTimeout()` can be used to set the time-out for specific statements. The value can be 0, which specifies no wait.|  
|loginTimeout|int [0..65535]|15|The number of seconds the driver should wait before timing out a failed connection. A zero value indicates that the timeout is the default system timeout, which is specified as 15 seconds by default. A non-zero value is the number of seconds the driver should wait before timing out a failed connection.<br /><br /> If you specify a Virtual Network Name in the **Server** connection property, you should specify a timeout value of three minutes or more to allow sufficient time for a failover connection to succeed. See [JDBC Driver Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](../../connect/jdbc/jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability--disaster-recovery.md) for more information.|  
|multiSubnetFailover|Boolean|false|Always specify **multiSubnetFailover=true** when connecting to the availability group listener of a SQL Server 2012 availability group or a SQL Server 2012 Failover Cluster Instance. **multiSubnetFailover=true** configures Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server to provide faster detection of and connection to the (currently) active server. Possible values are true and false. See [JDBC Driver Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](../../connect/jdbc/jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability--disaster-recovery.md) for more information.<br /><br /> You can programmatically access the **multiSubnetFailover** connection property with [getPropertyInfo](../../connect/jdbc/reference/getpropertyinfo-method--sqlserverdriver-.md), [getMultiSubnetFailover](../../connect/jdbc/reference/getmultisubnetfailover-method--sqlserverdatasource-.md), and [setMultiSubnetFailover](../../connect/jdbc/reference/setmultisubnetfailover-method--sqlserverdatasource-.md).<br /><br /> **Note:**  Beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server it is no longer required to set multiSubnetFailover to true when connecting to an Availability Group Listener. A new property, **transparentNetworkIPResolution**, which is enabled by default, provides the detection of and connection to the (currently) active server.|  
|packetSize|int [-1&#124; 0 &#124; 512..32767]|8000|The network packet size used to communicate with SQL Server, specified in bytes. A value of -1 indicates using the server default packet size. A value of 0 indicates using the maximum value, which is 32767. If this property is set to a value outside the acceptable range, an exception will occur.<br /><br /> **Important:**  We do not recommend using the packetSize property when the encryption is enabled (encrypt=true). Otherwise, the driver might raise a connection error. For more information, see the [setPacketSize](../../connect/jdbc/reference/setpacketsize-method--sqlserverdatasource-.md) method of the [SQLServerDataSource](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverdatasource-class.md) class.|  
|password|String<br /><br /> [<=128 char]|null|The database password.|  
|portNumber, port|int [0..65535]|1433|The port where SQL Server is listening. If the port number is specified in the connection string, no request to sqlbrowser is made. When the port and instanceName are both specified, the connection is made to the specified port. However, the **instanceName** is validated and an error is thrown if it does not match the port.<br /><br /> **Important:** We recommend that the port number always be specified, as this is more secure than using sqlbrowser.|  
|responseBuffering|String<br /><br /> ["full"&#124;"adaptive"]|adaptive|If this property is set to "adaptive", the minimum possible data is buffered when necessary. The default mode is "adaptive".<br /><br /> When this property is set to "full", the entire result set is read from the server when a statement is executed.<br /><br /> **Note:** After upgrading the JDBC driver from version 1.2, the default buffering behavior will be "adaptive." If your application has never set the "responseBuffering" property and you want to keep the version 1.2 default behavior in your application, you must set the responseBufferring propery to "full" either in the connection properties or by using the [setResponseBuffering](../../connect/jdbc/reference/setresponsebuffering-method--sqlserverstatement-.md) method of the [SQLServerStatement](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverstatement-class.md) object.|  
|selectMethod|String<br /><br /> ["direct"&#124;"cursor"]|direct|If this property is set to "cursor," a database cursor is created for each query created on the connection for TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY and CONCUR_READ_ONLY cursors. This property is typically required only if the application generates very large result sets that cannot be fully contained in client memory. When this property is set to "cursor," only a limited number of result set rows are retained in client memory. The default behavior is that all result set rows are retained in client memory. This behavior provides the fastest performance when the application is processing all rows.|  
|sendStringParametersAsUnicode|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|true|If the **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property is set to "true", String parameters are sent to the server in Unicode format.<br /><br /> If the **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property is set to “false", String parameters are sent to the server in non-Unicode format such as ASCII/MBCS instead of Unicode.<br /><br /> The default value for the **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property is "true".<br /><br /> **Note:** The **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property is only checked when sending a parameter value with **CHAR**, **VARCHAR**, or **LONGVARCHAR** JDBC types. The new JDBC 4.0 national character methods, such as the setNString, setNCharacterStream, and setNClob methods of [SQLServerPreparedStatement](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverpreparedstatement-class.md) and [SQLServerCallableStatement](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlservercallablestatement-class.md) classes, always send their parameter values to the server in Unicode regardless of the setting of this property.<br /><br /> For optimal performance with the **CHAR**, **VARCHAR**, and **LONGVARCHAR** JDBC data types, an application should set the **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property to "false" and use the setString, setCharacterStream, and setClob non-national character methods of the [SQLServerPreparedStatement](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverpreparedstatement-class.md) and [SQLServerCallableStatement](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlservercallablestatement-class.md) classes.<br /><br /> When the application sets the **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property to "false" and uses a non-national character method to access Unicode data types on the server side (such as **nchar**, **nvarchar** and **ntext**), some data might be lost if the database collation does not support the characters in the String parameters passed by the non-national character method.<br /><br /> Note that an application should use the setNString, setNCharacterStream, and setNClob national character methods of the [SQLServerPreparedStatement](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverpreparedstatement-class.md) and [SQLServerCallableStatement](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlservercallablestatement-class.md) classes for the **NCHAR**, **NVARCHAR**, and **LONGNVARCHAR** JDBC data types.|  
|sendTimeAsDatetime|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|true|This property was added in SQL Server JDBC Driver 3.0.<br /><br /> When true, java.sql.Time values will be sent to the server as SQL Server**datetime** values.<br /><br /> When false, java.sql.Time values will be sent to the server as SQL Server**time** values.<br /><br /> **sendTimeAsDatetime** can also be modified programmatically with [SQLServerDataSource.setSendTimeAsDatetime](../../connect/jdbc/reference/setsendtimeasdatetime-method--sqlserverdatasource-.md).<br /><br /> The default value for this property may change in a future release.<br /><br /> For more information about how the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server configures java.sql.Time values before sending them to the server, see [Configuring How java.sql.Time Values are Sent to the Server](../../connect/jdbc/configuring-how-java.sql.time-values-are-sent-to-the-server.md).|  
|serverName, server|String|null|The computer running SQL Server.<br /><br /> You can also specify the Virtual Network Name of a AlwaysOn Availability Groups availability group. See [JDBC Driver Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](../../connect/jdbc/jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability--disaster-recovery.md) for more information.|  
|serverSpn|String|null|Beginning in Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.2 for SQL Server, this optional property can be used to specify the Service Principal Name (SPN) for a Java Kerberos connection.  It is used in conjunction with **authenticationScheme**.<br /><br /> To specify the SPN, it can be in the form of: “MSSQLSvc/fqdn:port@REALM” where fqdn is the fully-qualified domain name, port is the port number, and REALM is the Kerberos realm of the SQL Server in upper-case letters.<br /><br /> Note: the @REALM is optional if the default realm of the client (as specified in the Kerberos configuration) is the same as the Kerberos realm for the SQL Server.<br /><br /> For more information on using **serverSpn** with Java Kerberos, see [Using Kerberos Integrated Authentication to Connect to SQL Server](../../connect/jdbc/using-kerberos-integrated-authentication-to-connect-to-sql-server.md).|  
|serverNameAsACE|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|false|Beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server, set to "true" to indicate that the driver should translate the Unicode server name to ASCII compatible encoding (Punycode) for the connection. If this setting is false, the driver connects using the server name as provided by the user.<br /><br /> See [International Features of the JDBC Driver](../../connect/jdbc/international-features-of-the-jdbc-driver.md) for more details.|  
|transparentNetworkIPResolution|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|true|Beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server, this property, transparentNetworkIPResolution, provides faster detection of and connection to the (currently) active server. Possible values are true and false with true as the default value.<br /><br /> Prior to Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server, an application had to set the connection string to include “multiSubnetFailover=true” to indicate that it was connecting to an AlwaysOn Availability Group. Without setting the multiSubnetFailover connection keyword to true, an application might experience a timeout while connecting to an AlwaysOn Availability Group. Beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server, an application does not need to set multiSubnetFailover to true anymore. <br /><br />**Note:** When transparentNetworkIPResolution=true, the first connection attempt uses 500ms as the timeout. Any subsequent attemps use the same timeout logic as used by the multiSubnetFailover property.|  
|columnEncryptionSetting|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|false|Set to "true" to use the Always Encrypted (AE) feature beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server. When AE is enabled, the JDBC driver transparently encrypts and decrypts sensitive data stored in encrypted database columns in the SQL Server.<br /><br /> See  [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC Driver](../Topic/Using%20Always%20Encrypted%20with%20the%20JDBC%20Driver.md) for more details.<br /><br /> **Note:** Always Encrypted is available with SQL Server 2016 or newer versions.|  
|trustServerCertificate|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|false|Set to "true" to specify that the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server will not validate the SQL Server SSL certificate.<br /><br /> If "true", the SQL Server SSL certificate is automatically trusted when the communication layer is encrypted using SSL.<br /><br /> If "false", the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server will validate the server SSL certificate. If the server certificate validation fails, the driver will raise an error and terminate the connection. The default value is "false". Make sure the value passed to **serverName** exactly matches the Common Name (CN) or DNS name in the Subject Alternate Name in the server certificate for an SSL connection to succeed. For more information, see [Understanding SSL Support](../../connect/jdbc/understanding-ssl-support.md).<br /><br /> **Note:** This property is used in combination with the **encrypt**/**authentication** properties. This property only affects server SSL certificate validation if and only if the connection uses SSL encryption.|  
|trustStore|String|null|The path (including filename) to the certificate trustStore file. The trustStore file contains the list of certificates that the client trusts.<br /><br /> When this property is unspecified or set to null, the driver will rely on the trust manager factory's look up rules to determine which certificate store to use.<br /><br /> **The default SunX509 TrustManagerFactory tries to locate the trusted material in the following search order:**<br /><br /> A file specified by the "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" Java Virtual Machine (JVM) system property.<br /><br /> "\<java-home>/lib/security/jssecacerts" file.<br /><br /> "\<java-home>/lib/security/cacerts" file.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> For more information, see the SUNX509 TrustManager Interface documentation on the Sun Microsystems Web site.<br /><br /> **Note:** This property only affects the certificate trustStore lookup, if and only if the connection uses SSL encryption and the **trustServerCertificate** property is set to "false".|  
|trustStorePassword|String|null|The password used to check the integrity of the trustStore data.<br /><br /> If the trustStore property is set but the trustStorePassword property is not set, the integrity of the trustStore is not checked.<br /><br /> When both trustStore and trustStorePassword properties are unspecified, the driver will use the JVM system properties, "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" and "javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword". If the "javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword" system property is not specified, the integrity of the trustStore is not checked.<br /><br /> If the trustStore property is not set but the trustStorePassword property is set, the JDBC driver will use the file specified by the "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" as a trust store and the integrity of the trust store is checked by using the specified trustStorePassword. This might be needed when the client application does not want to store the password in the JVM system property.<br /><br /> **Note:**  The trustStorePassword property only affects the certificate trustStore lookup, if and only if the connection uses SSL connection and the **trustServerCertificate** property is set to "false".|  
|userName, user|String<br /><br /> [<=128 char]|null|The database user.|  
|workstationID|String<br /><br /> [<=128 char]|\<empty string>|The workstation ID. Used to identify the specific workstation in various SQL Server profiling and logging tools. If none is specified, the \<empty string> is used.|  
|xopenStates|boolean<br /><br /> ["true"&#124;"false"]|false|Set to "true" to specify that the driver returns XOPEN-compliant state codes in exceptions. The default is to return SQL 99 state codes.|  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server takes the server default values for connection properties except for ANSI_DEFAULTS and IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS. The Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server automatically sets ANSI_DEFAULTS to ON and IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS to OFF.
