|Product Name|SQL Server|

|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|

## Explanation  
 When objects in a database are replicated, they are marked as replicated in the system table **sysarticles** (for snapshot and transactional publications) or **sysmergearticles** (for merge publications). If you attempt drop a replicated object, this error is raised.  
  
## User Action  
 Ensure the database object is not replicated before attempting to drop it. For example:  
  
-   If the error occurs in the publication database, drop the article from the publication before dropping the object. For more information, see [Add Articles to and Drop Articles from Existing Publications](../../relational-databases/replication/publish/add-articles-to-and-drop-articles-from-existing-publications.md).  
  
-   If the error occurs in the subscription database, drop the subscription before dropping the object. For more information, see [Subscribe to Publications](../../relational-databases/replication/subscribe-to-publications.md). For subscriptions to transactional publications, it is possible to drop the subscription to an individual article rather than the entire publication. For more information, see [sp_dropsubscription &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-dropsubscription-transact-sql.md).  
  
 If this error occurs in a database that is not replicated, execute [sp_removedbreplication &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-removedbreplication-transact-sql.md) to ensure objects in the database are not marked as replicated.
