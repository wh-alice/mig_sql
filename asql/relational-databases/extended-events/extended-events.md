# Extended Events
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2014-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/extended-events/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2014-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Extended Events has a highly scalable and highly configurable architecture that allows users to collect as much or as little information as is necessary to troubleshoot or identify a performance problem.  

You can find more information about Extended Events at:

- [Quick Start: Extended events in SQL Server](../../relational-databases/extended-events/quick-start-extended-events-in-sql-server.md)
- Blogs: [SQL Server Extended Events](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/extended_events/)

  
## Benefits of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Extended Events  
 Extended Events is a light weight performance monitoring system that uses very few performance resources. Extended Events provides two graphical user interfaces (**New Session Wizard** and **New Session**) to create, modify, display, and analyze your session data.  
  
## Extended Events Concepts  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Extended Events (Extended Events) builds on existing concepts, such as an event or an event consumer, uses concepts from Event Tracing for Windows, and introduces new concepts.  
  
 The following table describes the concepts in Extended Events.

## Extended Events Architecture  
 Extended Events (Extended Events) is a general event-handling system for server systems. The Extended Events infrastructure supports the correlation of data from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and under certain conditions, the correlation of data from the operating system and database applications. In the latter case, Extended Events output must be directed to Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) to correlate the event data with operating system or application event data.  
  
 All applications have execution points that are useful both inside and outside an application. Inside the application, asynchronous processing may be enqueued using information that is collected during the initial execution of a task. Outside the application, execution points provide monitoring utilities with information about the behavioral and performance characteristics of the monitored application.  
  
 Extended Events supports using event data outside a process. This data is typically used by:  
  
-   Tracing tools, such as SQL Trace and System Monitor.  
  
-   Logging tools, such as the Windows event log or the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log.  
  
-   Users administering a product or developing applications on a product.  
  
 Extended Events has the following key design aspects:  
  
-   The Extended Events engine is event agnostic. This enables the engine to bind any event to any target because the engine is not constrained by event content. For more information about the Extended Events engine, see [SQL Server Extended Events Engine](../../relational-databases/extended-events/sql-server-extended-events-engine.md).  
  
-   Events are separated from event consumers, which are called *targets* in Extended Events. This means that any target can receive any event. In addition, any event that is raised can be automatically consumed by the target, which can log or provide additional event context. For more information, see [SQL Server Extended Events Targets](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e281684c-40d1-4cf9-a0d4-7ea1ecffa384).  
  
-   Events are distinct from the action to take when an event occurs. Therefore, any action can be associated with any event.  
  
-   Predicates can dynamically filter when event data should be captured. This adds to the flexibility of the Extended Events infrastructure. For more information, see [SQL Server Extended Events Packages](../../relational-databases/extended-events/sql-server-extended-events-packages.md).  
  
 Extended Events can synchronously generate event data (and asynchronously process that data) which provides a flexible solution for event handling. In addition, Extended Events provides the following features:  
  
-   A unified approach to handling events across the server system, while enabling users to isolate specific events for troubleshooting purposes.  
  
-   Integration with, and support for existing ETW tools.  
  
-   A fully configurable event handling mechanism that is based on [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)].  
  
-   The ability to dynamically monitor active processes, while having minimal effect on those processes.  
  
-   A default system health session that runs without any noticeable performance effects. The session collects system data that you can use to help troubleshoot performance issues. For more information, see [Use the system_health Session](../../relational-databases/extended-events/use-the-system-health-session.md).  
  
## Extended Events Tasks  

Using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] to execute [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] Data Definition Language (DDL) statements, dynamic management views and functions, or catalog views, you can create simple or complex [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Extended Events troubleshooting solutions for your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] environment.
