# ERROR_SEVERITY (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns the severity of the error that caused the CATCH block of a TRYâ€¦CATCH construct to be run.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
-- Syntax for SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
ERROR_SEVERITY ( )  
```  
  
## Return Types  
 **int**  
  
## Return Value  
 When called in a CATCH block, returns the severity of the error message that caused the CATCH block to be run.  
  
 Returns NULL if called outside the scope of a CATCH block.  
  
## Remarks  
 ERROR_SEVERITY may be called anywhere within the scope of a CATCH block.  
  
 ERROR_SEVERITY returns the error severity regardless of how many times it is run, or where it is run within the scope of the CATCH block. This is in contrast to functions like @@ERROR, which only returns the error number in the statement immediately after the one that causes an error, or in the first statement of a CATCH block.  
  
 In nested CATCH blocks, ERROR_SEVERITY returns the error severity specific to the scope of the CATCH block in which it is referenced. For example, the CATCH block of an outer TRY...CATCH construct could have a nested TRY...CATCH construct. Within the nested CATCH block, ERROR_SEVERITY returns the severity from the error that invoked the nested CATCH block. If ERROR_SEVERITY is run in the outer CATCH block, it returns the severity from the error that invoked that CATCH block.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using ERROR_SEVERITY in a CATCH block  
 The following example shows a `SELECT` statement that generates a divide-by-zero error. The severity of the error is returned.  
  
```  
  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Generate a divide-by-zero error.  
    SELECT 1/0;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT ERROR_SEVERITY() AS ErrorSeverity;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Using ERROR_SEVERITY in a CATCH block with other error-handling tools  
 The following example shows a `SELECT` statement that generates a divide by zero error. Along with the severity, information that relates to the error is returned.  
  
```  
  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Generate a divide-by-zero error.  
    SELECT 1/0;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT  
        ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber,  
        ERROR_SEVERITY() AS ErrorSeverity,  
        ERROR_STATE() AS ErrorState,  
        ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS ErrorProcedure,  
        ERROR_LINE() AS ErrorLine,  
        ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
```  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
  
### C. Using ERROR_SEVERITY in a CATCH block  
 The following example shows a `SELECT` statement that generates a divide-by-zero error. The severity of the error is returned.  
  
```  
  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Generate a divide-by-zero error.  
    SELECT 1/0;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT ERROR_SEVERITY() AS ErrorSeverity;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
```  
  
### D. Using ERROR_SEVERITY in a CATCH block with other error-handling tools  
 The following example shows a `SELECT` statement that generates a divide by zero error. Along with the severity, information that relates to the error is returned.  
  
```  
  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Generate a divide-by-zero error.  
    SELECT 1/0;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT  
        ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber,  
        ERROR_SEVERITY() AS ErrorSeverity,  
        ERROR_STATE() AS ErrorState,  
        ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS ErrorProcedure,  
        ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
```
