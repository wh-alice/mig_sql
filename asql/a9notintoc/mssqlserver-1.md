## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]|  
|Event ID|-1|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|An error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server.  When connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], this failure may be caused by the fact that under the default settings [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not allow remote connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 28 - Server doesn't support requested protocol) (Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], Error: -1)|  
  
## Explanation  
The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client cannot connect to the server. This error could be caused by one of the following reasons:  
  
-   A specified [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance name is not valid.  
  
-   The TCP, or named pipes protocols are not enabled.  
  
-   The firewall on the server has refused the connection.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service (sqlbrowser) is not started.  
  
## User Action  
To resolve this error, try one of the following actions:  
  
-   Check the spelling of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance name that is specified in the connection string.  
  
-   Use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager tool to enable [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to accept remote connections over the TCP or named pipes protocols. For more information about the accepting remote connections, see [Enable or Disable a Server Network Protocol](../database-engine/configure/windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol.md).  
  
-   Make sure that you have configured the firewall on the server instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to open ports for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser port (UDP 1434).  
  
-   Make sure that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service is started on the server.
