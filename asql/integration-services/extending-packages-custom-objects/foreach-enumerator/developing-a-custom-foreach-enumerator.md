# Developing a Custom ForEach Enumerator
  [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] uses foreach enumerators to iterate over the items in a collection and perform the same tasks for each element. [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] includes a variety of foreach enumerators that support the most commonly used collections, such as all the files in a folder, all the tables in a database, or all the elements of a list stored in a package variable. If the foreach enumerators and collections that are provided do not entirely meet your requirements, you can create a custom foreach enumerator.  
  
 To create a custom foreach enumerator, you have to create a class that inherits from the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ForEachEnumerator> base class, apply the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DtsForEachEnumeratorAttribute> attribute to your new class, and override the important methods and properties of the base class, including the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ForEachEnumerator.GetEnumerator%2A> method.

 This section describes how to create, configure, and code a custom foreach enumerator and its custom user interface.
