# Power Pivot Minimum-Privilege Example - SharePoint 2016
  This topic describes an example [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint 2016 configuration with minimum privileges. The configuration utilizes a different account for each of the three components and each account has the minimum level of privileges.  
  
||  
|-|  
|**[!INCLUDE[applies](../../../../a9retired/includes/applies-md.md)]**  SharePoint 2016|  
  
## Summary of Accounts  
 [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint 2016 supports the use of the Network Service account for the Analysis Services service account. The Network Service account is not a supported scenario with SharePoint 2010. For more information on Service accounts, see [Configure Windows Service Accounts and Permissions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms143504.aspx) (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms143504.aspx).  
  
 The following table summarizes the three accounts used in this example of a minimum privileged configuration.  
  
|Scope|Name|  
|-----------|----------|  
|SharePoint Administrator account|**SPAdmin**|  
|SharePoint Farm account|**SPFarm**|  
|Analysis Services service account|**SPsvc**|  
  
### The SharePoint Administrator account (SpAdmin)  
 **SPAdmin** is a domain account you use to install and configure the farm. It is the account used to run the SharePoint Configuration Wizard and the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Configuration Tool for SharePoint 2016.The **SPAdmin** account is the only account that requires local Administrator rights. Before running the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Configuration tool, grant the **SPAdmin** account privileges to the SQL Server database instance where SharePoint creates content and configuration databases. To configure the SPAdmin account in a minimum privilege scenario, it should be a member of the roles **securityadmin** and **dbcreator**.  
  
### The Farm account (SPFarm)  
 **SPFarm** is a domain account that the SharePoint Timer service and the web application for Central Administration use to access the SharePoint content database. This account does not need to be a local administrator. The SharePoint configuration wizard grants the proper minimal privilege in the back-end SQL Server database.The minimum SQL Server privilege configuration is membership in the roles **securityadmin** and **dbcreator**.  
  
### The Service Account for Power Pivot Service (SPsvc)  
 If a new SharePoint farm is not configured before you run the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Configuration tool, then by default the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Configuration tool will create the following:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Service application.  
  
-   Secure Store application.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] configuration tool configures both service applications in the default application pool. That application pool is typically configured to run as the SPFarm account, which has access to many resources that a service account does not require. To make the environment a minimum-privileged environment, configure a new domain account to be use by the appropriate application pool and web application.  
  
 **To create a new domain account SPsvc to be used as a SharePoint Service account:**  
  
1.  In SharePoint Central Administration, select **Security**.  
  
2.  Select **Configure Service Accounts**  
  
3.  Select **Register new managed account**.  
  
 The **SPSvc** account has no local administrator privileges and SPsvc will not have any privileges in the SharePoint database. The only privileges SPsvc requires is administrative rights to the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Instance of the Analysis Services.  
  
 **To configure the appropriate application pool to use the SPsvc account :**  
  
1.  In SharePoint Central Administration, select **Security**.  
  
2.  Select **Configure Service Accounts**.  
  
3.  Select the service application pool used by the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Service application. Then select the SPSvc account.  
  
 **To Grant access to the web application with PowerShell:**  
  
1.  Run the SharePoint 2016 Management Shell with administrator privileges.  
  
2.  Run the following PowerShell code:  
  
    ```  
    $webApp = Get-SPWebApplication "http://<servername>"  
    $webApp.GrantAccessToProcessIdentity("DOMAIN\<ServiceAccountName>")  
  
    ```
