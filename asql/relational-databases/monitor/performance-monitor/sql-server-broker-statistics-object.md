# SQL Server, Broker Statistics Object
  The SQLServer:Broker Statistics performance object contains performance counters that report general [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] information for an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)]. The following table lists the counters that this object contains:  
  
|SQL Server Broker Statistics counters|Description|  
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**Activation Errors Total**|The number of times a [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] activation stored procedure exited with an error.|  
|**Broker Transaction Rollbacks**|The number of rolled-back transactions that contained DML statements related to [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)], such as SEND and RECEIVE.|  
|**Corrupted Messages Total**|The number of corrupted messages that were received by the instance.|  
|**Dequeued Transmission Msgs/sec**|The number of messages that have been removed from the [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sssb-md.md)] transmission queue per second.|  
|**Dialog timer event count**|The number of timers active in the dialog protocol layer. This number corresponds to the number of active dialogs.|  
|**Dropped Messages Total**|The number of messages that were received by the instance, but could not be delivered to a queue.|

|**Enqueued Messages Total**|The total number of messages that have been put into the queues in the instance.|  
|**Enqueued Messages/sec**|The number of messages per second that have been put into the queues in the instance. This includes messages of all priority levels.|  
|**Enqueued P1 Msgs/sec**|The number of priority 1 messages per second that have been put into the queues in the instance.|  
|**Enqueued P2 Msgs/sec**|The number of priority 2 messages per second that have been put into the queues in the instance.|  
|**Enqueued P3 Msgs/sec**|The number of priority 3 messages per second that have been put into the queues in the instance.|  
|**Enqueued P4 Msgs/sec**|The number of priority 4 messages per second that have been put into the queues in the instance.|  
|**Enqueued P5 Msgs/sec**|The number of priority 5 messages per second that have been put into the queues in the instance.|  
|**Enqueued P6 Msgs/sec**|The number of priority 6 messages per second that have been put into the queues in the instance.|

|**Enqueued Transport Msg Frags/sec**|The number of message fragments per second that have been put into the queues in the instance.|  
|**Enqueued Transport Msgs Total**|The number of messages that have been put into the queues in the instance, counting only messages that arrived through the network.|  
|**Enqueued Transport Msgs/sec**|The number of messages per second that have been put into the queues in the instance, counting only messages that arrived through the network.|
