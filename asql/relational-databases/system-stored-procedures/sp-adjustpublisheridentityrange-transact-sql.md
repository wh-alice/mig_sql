# sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Adjusts the identity range on a publication and reallocates new ranges based on the threshold value on the publication. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange [ [ @publication = ] 'publication' ]  
    [ , [ @table_name = ] 'table_name' ]  
    [ , [ @table_owner= ] 'table_owner' ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@publication=**] **'***publication***'**  
 Is the name of the publication in which new identity ranges are reallocated. *publication* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@table_name=**] **'***table_name***'**  
 Is the name of the table in which new identity ranges are reallocated. *table_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@table_owner=**] **'***table_owner***'**  
 Is the owner of the table at the Publisher. *table_owner* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL. If *table_owner* is not specified, the name of the current user is used.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange** is used in all types of replication.  
  
 For a publication which has the auto identity range enabled, the Distribution Agent or Merge Agent is responsible for automatically adjusting the identity range in a publication based on its threshold value. However, if for some reason the Distribution Agent or Merge Agent has not been run for a period of time, and identity range resource have been consumed heavily to the point of threshold, users can call **sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange** to allocate a new range of values for a Publisher.  
  
 When executing **sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange**, either *publication* or *table_name* must be specified. If both or neither are specified an error is returned.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role or **db_owner** fixed database role can execute **sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange**.
