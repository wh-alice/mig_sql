# Options (Environment - Help - General Page)
Use the **Options** dialog box to choose documentation sets and decide whether to display topics internally in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio or externally in a separate window. To access this dialog box, click **Options** on the **Tools** menu, expand **Help** in the **Environment** node, and then click **General**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Changes made to the options on this page do not take effect until the environment is restarted.  
  
## Settings  
**Show Help using**  
Specifies how Help is displayed. Select **External Help Viewer** from the drop-down list to display topics in an external floating window. Select **Integrated Help Viewer** to display Help topics in a Web browser window docked inside SQL Server Management Studio.  
  
**Search results per page**  
Specifies the number of topics that are displayed on a single **Search Results** page.

Specifies whether an abstract for each topic is shown in the **Search Results** list and on the **How do I** tab.  
  
**Reuse topic window**  
When this check box is selected, specifies that Help topics display in the same window so you can navigate among topics using the **Back** and **Forward** buttons. When cleared, this check box specifies that a new window is opened for each topic.  
  
**Highlight search terms**  
Specifies whether search strings are highlighted within **Search Results** topics for local Help.
