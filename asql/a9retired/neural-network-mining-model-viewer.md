# Neural Network (Mining Model Viewer)
  Use the **Neural Net** viewer to explore mining models that are based on the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Neural Network algorithm or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Logistic Regression algorithm.  
  
 **For More Information:** [Microsoft Neural Network Algorithm](../analysis-services/data-mining/microsoft-neural-network-algorithm.md), [Microsoft Logistic Regression Algorithm](../analysis-services/data-mining/microsoft-logistic-regression-algorithm.md),[Browse a Model Using the Microsoft Neural Network Viewer](../analysis-services/data-mining/browse-a-model-using-the-microsoft-neural-network-viewer.md)  
  
## Options  
 **Refresh viewer content**  
 Reload the mining model in the viewer.  
  
 **Mining Model**  
 Choose a mining model to view, from those in the current mining structure. The mining model will open in its associated viewer.  
  
 **Viewer**  
 Choose a viewer to use to explore the selected mining model. You can use the custom viewer, or the **Microsoft Generic Content Tree Viewer**. You can also use plug-in viewers if available.  
  
 **Input**  
 Use this area to choose input attributes and values, so that you can later explore how these affect the outcome.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Attribute**|Choose an input attribute from the list. If you leave the selection as the default, **\<All>**, the chart shows a list of all input attributes, ranked by their impact on the predictable attribute.|  
|**Value**|Choose a value for the input attribute.|  
  
 **Output**  
 Use these controls to choose a predictable attribute and value to analyze and compare in the bar graph. If you do not change the selections, the bar graph compares the top two outcome states.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Output Attribute**|Choose a predictable attribute. If you did not define the column as a predictable one when you created the model, you cannot add it here.|  
|**Value 1**|Choose a state of the predictable attribute to compare to the state that is contained in **Value 2**.<br /><br /> You can compare any two discrete or discretized values; however, you cannot compare a value to its complement, as you can in other viewers.|  
|**Value 2**|Select a state of the predictable attribute to compare to the state that is contained in **Value 1**.|  
  
 **Variables**  
 This part of the **Neural Network** tab contains an interactive bar graph, which responds to the selections that you made for input and outcome attributes. Because a neural network calculates the likelihood that a particular value influences a particular outcome, you can choose any combination of inputs, and the bar chart will display how that combination affects the pair of outcomes that you are comparing.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Attribute**|Shows the name of the input attribute you selected in **Attribute**.|  
|**Value**|Shows the value for the selected input attribute.|  
|**Favors \<Value 1>**|Displays a bar that indicates how much this particular attribute-value combination affects the target outcome chosen in **Value 1**.|  
|**Favors \<Value 2>**|Displays a bar that indicates how much this particular attribute-value combination affects the target outcome chosen in **Value 2**.|
