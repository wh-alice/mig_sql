# sp_addmergepushsubscription_agent (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Adds a new agent job used to schedule synchronization of a push subscription to a merge publication. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When configuring a Publisher with a remote Distributor, the values supplied for all parameters, including *job_login* and *job_password*, are sent to the Distributor as plain text. You should encrypt the connection between the Publisher and its remote Distributor before executing this stored procedure. For more information, see [Enable Encrypted Connections to the Database Engine &#40;SQL Server Configuration Manager&#41;](../Topic/Enable%20Encrypted%20Connections%20to%20the%20Database%20Engine%20\(SQL%20Server%20Configuration%20Manager\).md).

 [ **@subscriber_security_mode =** ] *subscriber_security_mode*  
 Is the security mode to use when connecting to a Subscriber when synchronizing. *subscriber_security_mode* is **int**, with a default of 1. If **0**, specifies [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication. If **1**, specifies Windows Authentication.  
  
 [ **@subscriber_login =** ] **'***subscriber_login***'**

If a subscriber password is used, it is automatically encrypted.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
