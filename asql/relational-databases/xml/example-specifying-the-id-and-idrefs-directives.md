# Example: Specifying the ID and IDREFS Directives
  An element attribute can be specified as an **ID** type attribute, and the **IDREFS** attribute can then be used to refer to it. This enables intra-document links and is similar to the primary key and foreign key relationships in relational databases.  
  
 This example illustrates how the **ID** and **IDREFS** directives can be used to create attributes of **ID** and **IDREFS** types. Because IDs cannot be integer values, the ID values in this example are converted. In other words, they are type casted. Prefixes are used for the ID values.  
  
 Assume that you want to construct XML as shown in the following:  
  
```  
<Customer CustomerID="C1" SalesOrderIDList=" O11 O22 O33..." >  
    <SalesOrder SalesOrderID="O11" OrderDate="..." />  
    <SalesOrder SalesOrderID="O22" OrderDate="..." />  
    <SalesOrder SalesOrderID="O33" OrderDate="..." />  
    ...  
</Customer>  
```  
  
 The `SalesOrderIDList` attribute of the < `Customer` > element is a multivalued attribute that refers to the `SalesOrderID` attribute of the < `SalesOrder` > element. To establish this link, the `SalesOrderID` attribute must be declared of `ID` type, and the `SalesOrderIDList` attribute of the < `Customer`> element must be declared of `IDREFS` type. Because a customer can request several orders, the `IDREFS` type is used.  
  
 Elements of **IDREFS** type also have more than one value. Therefore, you have to use a separate select clause that will reuse the same tag, parent, and key column information. The `ORDER BY` then has to ensure that the sequence of rows that make up the **IDREFS** values appears grouped together under their parent element.  
  
 This is the query that produces the XML you want. The query uses the `ID` and `IDREFS` directives to overwrite the types in the column names (`SalesOrder!2!SalesOrderID!ID`, `Customer!1!SalesOrderIDList!IDREFS`).  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT  1 as Tag,  
        0 as Parent,  
        C.CustomerID       [Customer!1!CustomerID],  
        NULL               [Customer!1!SalesOrderIDList!IDREFS],  
        NULL               [SalesOrder!2!SalesOrderID!ID],  
        NULL               [SalesOrder!2!OrderDate]  
FROM   Sales.Customer C   
UNION ALL   
SELECT  1 as Tag,  
        0 as Parent,  
        C.CustomerID,  
        'O-'+CAST(SalesOrderID as varchar(10)),   
        NULL,  
        NULL  
FROM   Sales.Customer AS C  
INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH  
    ON  C.CustomerID = SOH.CustomerID  
UNION ALL  
SELECT 2 as Tag,  
       1 as Parent,  
        C.CustomerID,  
        NULL,  
        'O-'+CAST(SalesOrderID as varchar(10)),  
        OrderDate  
FROM   Sales.Customer AS C  
INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH  
    ON  C.CustomerID = SOH.CustomerIDORDER BY [Customer!1!CustomerID] ,  
         [SalesOrder!2!SalesOrderID!ID],  
         [Customer!1!SalesOrderIDList!IDREFS]  
FOR XML EXPLICIT;  
```
