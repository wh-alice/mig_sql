# Add a Border Frame to a Chart (Report Builder and SSRS)
  To give a chart more visual impact, consider using a border frame around the outside of the chart. You can select a border frame by using the **Chart Properties** dialog box or by using the Properties pane. The chart border frames cannot be applied to any other data region.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../reporting-services/report-builder/includes/ssrbrddup-md.md)]  
  
### To apply a border to a chart  
  
1.  Right-click anywhere on the chart and select **Chart Properties**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you do not see the **Chart Properties**, point to **Chart** on the shortcut menu and select **Chart Properties**.  
  
2.  Select **Border**, and click the type of border to apply to the chart.  
  
3.  (Optional) Select a value or type an expression that represents the style of the border.  
  
4.  (Optional) Specify the color of the line that will be drawn around the chart as the border.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The **Line color** list contains common colors. If you want to select from a list of more colors, click **More colors** in the list or click the expression (**fx**) button next to the list to bring up the **Expression** editor.  
  
5.  (Optional) Specify the width of the border. Valid values are between 0.25pt and 20pt. Consider keeping the size of your border to between 1 and 3pt for the best visual effect.  
  
6.  (Optional) If your report contains a background color other than white, consider defining a page color that is the same color. The page color is the background color outside of the border line.  
  
7.  (Optional) If you choose a Frame type, specify a style and color for the frame. The **Frame fill color** list contains common colors.
