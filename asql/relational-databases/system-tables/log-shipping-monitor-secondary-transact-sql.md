|**primary_server**|**sysname**|The name of the primary instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] in the log shipping configuration.|  
|**primary_database**|**sysname**|The name of the primary database in the log shipping configuration.|  
|**restore_threshold**|**int**|The number of minutes allowed to elapse between restore operations before an alert is generated.|

|**last_copied_file**|**nvarchar(500)**|The filename of the last backup file copied to the secondary server.|  
|**last_copied_date**|**datetime**|The time and date of the last copy operation to the secondary server.|  
|**last_copied_date_utc**|**datetime**|The time and date of the last copy operation to the secondary server, expressed in Coordinated Universal Time.|  
|**last_restored_file**|**nvarchar(500)**|The filename of the last backup file restored to the secondary database.|  
|**last_restored_date**|**datetime**|The time and date of the last restore operation on the secondary database.|  
|**last_restored_date_utc**|**datetime**|The time and date of the last restore operation on the secondary database, expressed in Coordinated Universal Time.|  
|**last_restored_latency**|**int**|The amount of time, in minutes, that elapsed between when the log backup was created on the primary and when it was restored on the secondary.<br /><br /> The initial value is NULL.|
