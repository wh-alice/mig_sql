# Task Host Container
  The task host container encapsulates a single task. In [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../analysis-services/instances/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer, the task host is not configured separately; instead, it is configured when you set the properties of the task it encapsulates. For more information about the tasks that the task host containers encapsulate, see [Integration Services Tasks](../../integration-services/control-flow/integration-services-tasks.md).  
  
 This container extends the use of variables and event handlers to the task level. For more information, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Event Handlers](../../integration-services/integration-services-ssis-event-handlers.md) and [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Variables](../../integration-services/integration-services-ssis-variables.md).  
  
## Configuration of the Task Host  
 You can set properties in the **Properties** window of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] or programmatically.  
  
 For information about setting these properties in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], see [Set the Properties of a Task or Container](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/52d47ca4-fb8c-493d-8b2b-48bb269f859b).  
  
 For information about programmatically setting these properties, see <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.TaskHost>.
