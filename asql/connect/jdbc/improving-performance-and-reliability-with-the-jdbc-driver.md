# Improving Performance and Reliability with the JDBC Driver
![Download](../../ssdt/media/download.png)[Download JDBC Driver](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245496)

  One aspect of application development that is common to all applications is the constant need to improve performance and reliability. There are a number of techniques for doing this with the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server.  
  
 The topics in this section describe various techniques for improving application performance and reliability when using the JDBC driver.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Closing Objects when Not In Use](../../connect/jdbc/closing-objects-when-not-in-use.md)|Describes the importance of closing JDBC driver objects when they are no longer needed.|  
|[Managing Transaction Size](../../connect/jdbc/managing-transaction-size.md)|Describes techniques for improving transaction performance.|  
|[Working with Statements and Result Sets](../../connect/jdbc/working-with-statements-and-result-sets.md)|Describes techniques for improving performance when using the Statement or ResultSet objects.|  
|[Using Adaptive Buffering](../../connect/jdbc/using-adaptive-buffering.md)|Describes an adaptive buffering feature, which is designed to retrieve any kind of large-value data without the overhead of server cursors.|  
|[Sparse Columns](../../connect/jdbc/sparse-columns.md)|Discusses the JDBC driver's support for SQL Server sparse columns.|
