# TMSL Reference - Tabular Objects
  Applications that create, consume, or administer Tabular databases at the 1200 compatibility level, or that connect to a SQL Sever 2016 Analysis Services instance in tabular mode, can use the Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) for commands and object representations in JSON format.  
  
 This article documents the major objects of the TMSL schema used in scripts generated by SQL Server Management Studio, SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), and AMO PowerShell.  
  
 Object definitions are in JSON and used in TMSL commands like Create, Alter, and Delete. See [Commands in Tabular Model Scripting Language &#40;TMSL&#41;](../Topic/Commands%20in%20Tabular%20Model%20Scripting%20Language%20\(TMSL\).md) for a list of commands.  
  
## Main objects  
 The following table is list of the most commonly used objects in TMSL script.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[Database object &#40;TMSL&#41;](../../analysis-services/tabular-models-scripting-language-objects/database-object-tmsl.md)|Defines a Tabular database at compatibility level 1200 or greater, based on a model of the same level.|  
|[Model object &#40;TMSL&#41;](../../analysis-services/tabular-models-scripting-language-objects/model-object-tmsl.md)|Defines a Tabular model at compatibility level 1200 or greater.|

|[Tables object &#40;TMSL&#41;](../../analysis-services/tabular-models-scripting-language-objects/tables-object-tmsl.md)|Specifies the tables of the model.|  
|[Partitions object &#40;TMSL&#41;](../../analysis-services/tabular-models-scripting-language-objects/partitions-object-tmsl.md)|Defines storage of table rowsets, including calculated tables.|  
|[Relationships object &#40;TMSL&#41;](../../analysis-services/tabular-models-scripting-language-objects/relationships-object-tmsl.md)|Defines the relationships between tables.|
