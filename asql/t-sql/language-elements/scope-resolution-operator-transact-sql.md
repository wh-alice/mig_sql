# Scope Resolution Operator (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../integration-services/system/stored-procedures/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  The scope resolution operator **::** provides access to static members of a compound data type. A compound data type is one that contains multiple simple data types and methods.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows how to use the scope resolution operator to access the `GetRoot()` member of the `hierarchyid` type.  
  
```  
DECLARE @hid hierarchyid;  
SELECT @hid = hierarchyid::GetRoot();  
PRINT @hid.ToString();  
```
