# Distributor Information, Agents
  The **Agents** tab displays information about the agents and maintenance jobs that are associated with the Publisher and Subscriber.  
  
 The agents that are available in the **Agents** tab for a Distributor in Distributor view include all the agents that are available in the **Agents** tab for a Publisher. However, the **Agents** tab for a Distributor in Distributor view also includes a Distributor Agent and a Merge Agent.  
  
 For more information about the Snapshot, Log Reader, and Queue Reader agents, and maintenance jobs, see [Publisher Information, Agents](../../relational-databases/replication/publisher-information-agents.md).
