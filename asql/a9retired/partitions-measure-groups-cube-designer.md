# Partitions - Measure Groups (Cube Designer)
  Use the **Measure Groups** pane on the **Partitions** tab in Cube Designer to manage the partitions associated with each measure group in the cube.  
  
## Options  
 **Partitions**  
 Displays a grid containing the list of partitions that support the selected measure group. The grid contains the following columns:  
  
 **(Ordinal)**  
 Displays the ordinal position of the partition within the measure group.  
  
 Click to select the entire row for the partition.  
  
 **Partition Name**  
 Type the name of the selected partition.  
  
 **Source**  
 Type the table name (for table binding) or query (for query binding) that provides the fact table data for the selected partition.  
  
 Click the **...** button to display the **Partition Source** dialog box and define the source for the selected partition.  
  
 **Aggregation**  
 Displays the aggregation mode and the storage mode of the partition. The storage mode is displayed first: relational online analytical processing (ROLAP), multidimensional online analytical processing (MOLAP), or hybrid online analytical processing (HOLAP). The aggregation mode is displayed as a percentage of optimization requested, as a measure of space requested or used, or as the number of aggregations created. Click the **...** button to display the **Aggregation Design Wizard** and define the aggregation design for the specified partition.  
  
 **Description**  
 Type the optional description of the partition.
