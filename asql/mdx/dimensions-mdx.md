# Dimensions (MDX)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns a hierarchy specified by a numeric or string expression.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Numeric expression syntax  
Dimensions(Hierarchy_Number)  
  
String expression syntax  
Dimensions(Hierarchy_Name)  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Hierarchy_Number*  
 A valid numeric expression that specifies a hierarchy number.  
  
 *Hierarchy_Name*  
 A valid string expression that specifies a hierarchy name  
  
## Remarks  
 If a hierarchy number is specified, the **Dimensions** function returns a hierarchy whose zero-based position within the cube is specified hierarchy number.  
  
 If a hierarchy name is specified, the **Dimensions** function returns the specified hierarchy. Typically, you use this string version of the **Dimensions** function with user-defined functions.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Measures** dimension is always represented by `Dimensions(0)`.  
  
## Examples  
 The following examples use the **Dimensions** function to return the name, count of levels, and count of members of a specified hierarchy, using both a numeric expression and a string expression.  
  
```  
WITH MEMBER Measures.x AS Dimensions  
   ('[Product].[Product Model Lines]').Name  
SELECT Measures.x on 0  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
  
WITH MEMBER Measures.x AS Dimensions  
   ('[Product].[Product Model Lines]').Levels.Count  
SELECT Measures.x on 0  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
  
WITH MEMBER Measures.x AS Dimensions  
   ('[Product].[Product Model Lines]').Members.Count  
SELECT Measures.x on 0  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
  
WITH MEMBER Measures.x AS Dimensions(0).Name  
SELECT Measures.x on 0  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
  
WITH MEMBER Measures.x AS Dimensions(0).Levels.Count  
SELECT measures.x on 0  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
  
WITH MEMBER Measures.x AS Dimensions(0).Members.Count  
SELECT measures.x on 0  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
```
