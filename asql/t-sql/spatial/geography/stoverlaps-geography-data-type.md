# STOverlaps (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns 1 if a **geography** instance spatially overlaps another **geography** instance, or 0 if it does not.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STOverlaps ( other_geography )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *other_geography*  
 Is another **geography** instance to compare against the instance on which `STOverlaps()` is invoked.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **bit**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlBoolean**  
  
## Remarks  
 This method always returns null if the spatial reference IDs (SRIDs) of the **geography** instances do not match.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses `STOverlaps()` to test two **geography** instances for overlap.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geography;  
DECLARE @h geography;  
SET @g = geography::Parse('POLYGON ((-120.533 46.566, -118.283 46.1, -122.3 47.45, -120.533 46.566))');  
SET @h = geography::Parse('CURVEPOLYGON (COMPOUNDCURVE (CIRCULARSTRING (-122.200928 47.454094, -122.810669 47.00648, -122.942505 46.687131, -121.14624 45.786679, -119.119263 46.183634), (-119.119263 46.183634, -119.273071 47.107523), CIRCULARSTRING (-119.273071 47.107523, -120.640869 47.569114, -122.200928 47.454094)))');  
SELECT @g.STOverlaps(@h);  
```
