# Search Property List Editor
  Use this dialog box to add or delete search properties in a search property list.  
  
## To Use SQL Server Management Studio to Manage Search Property Lists  
 For information about how to create, view, or delete a search property list, and about how to configure a full-text index for property searching, see [Search Document Properties with Search Property Lists](../relational-databases/search/search-document-properties-with-search-property-lists.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Property Name**  
 Specify the name to be used to identify the property in full-text queries. A property name can contain internal spaces. The maximum length of **Property Name** is 256 characters. This name can be a user-friendly name, such as "Author" or "Home Address", or it can be the Windows canonical name of the property, such as **System.Author** or **System.Contact.HomeAddress**. **Property Name** must uniquely identify the property within the property set.  
  
 Developers use the property name to identify the property in the [CONTAINS](../Topic/CONTAINS%20\(Transact-SQL\).md) predicate. Therefore, when adding a property it is important to specify a value that meaningfully represents the property.  
  
 **Property Set GUID**  
 Specify the identifier of the property set to which the property belongs. This is a globally unique identifier (GUID). A property set is a group of logically related properties. For information about obtaining this value, see "Remarks," later in this topic.  
  
 **Property Int ID**  
 Specify the property integer identifier of the property. This pre-assigned value is a positive integer that is unique within the property set. For information about obtaining this value, see "Remarks," later in this topic.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Document properties that use string identifiers are not supported by full-text search.  
  
 **Property Description**  
 Optionally, specify a description of the property. This is a string of up to 512 characters. For example, a description could contain information about the property set of the property or information about a property that is not evident from its name.  
  
## Remarks  
 To add a search property to a search property list, you must specify the globally unique identifier (GUID) of the property set to which the property belongs and the property integer identifier of the property. A given combination of these must be unique in a given search property list. If you try to add an existing combination, the operation fails and issues an error. This means that you can configure only one name for a given property.  
  
 The property description is optional.
