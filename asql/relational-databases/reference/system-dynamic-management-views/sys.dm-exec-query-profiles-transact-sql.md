# sys.dm_exec_query_profiles (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2014-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../relational-databases/extended-events/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2014-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Monitors real time query progress while the query is in execution. For example, use this DMV to determine which part of the query is running slow. Join this DMV with other system DMVs using the columns identified in the description field. Or, join this DMV with other performance counters (such as Performance Monitor, xperf) by using the timestamp columns.  
  
## Table Returned  
 The counters returned are per operator per thread. The results are dynamic and do not match the results of existing options such as SET STATISTICS XML ON which only create output when the query is finished.

## General Remarks  
 If the query plan node does not have any IO, all the IO-related counters are set to NULL.  
  
 The IO-related counters reported by this DMV are more granular than the ones reported by SET STATISTICS IO in the following two ways:  
  
-   SET STATISTICS IO groups the counters for all IO to a given table together. With this DMV you will get separate counters for every node in the query plan that performs IO to the table.  
  
-   If there is a parallel scan, this DMV reports counters for each of the parallel threads working on the scan.
 
 Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1, the legacy query execution statistics profiling infrastructure exists side-by-side with a lightweight query execution statistics profiling infrastructure. The new query execution statistics profiling infrastructure dramatically reduces performance overhead of collecting per-operator query execution statistics, such as actual number of rows. This feature can be enabled either using global startup [trace flag 7412](../../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md), or is automatically turned on when query_thread_profile extended event is used.

>[!NOTE]
> CPU and elapsed times are not supported under the lightweight query execution statistics profiling infrastructure to reduce performance impact.

 SET STATISTICS XML ON and SET STATISTICS PROFILE ON always use the legacy query execution statistics profiling infrastructure.
  
## Permissions  
 On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] requires VIEW SERVER STATE permission on the server.  
  
 On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] Premium Tiers requires the VIEW DATABASE STATE permission in the database. On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] Standard and Basic Tiers requires the [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/sssds-md.md)] admin account.  
  
## Examples  
 Step 1: Login to a session in which you plan to run the query you will analyze with sys.dm_exec_query_profiles. To configure the query for profiling use SET STATISTICS PROFILE ON. Run your query in this same session.  
  
```  
--Configure query for profiling with sys.dm_exec_query_profiles  
SET STATISTICS PROFILE ON;  
GO  

--Or enable query profiling globally under SQL Server 2016 SP1 or above  
DBCC TRACEON (7412, -1);  
GO 
  
--Next, run your query in this session, or in any other session if query profiling has been enabled globally 
```  
  
 Step 2: Login to a second session that is different from the session in which your query is running.  
  
 The following statement summarizes the progress made by the query currently running in session 54. To do this, it calculates the total number of output rows from all threads for each node, and compares it to the estimated number of output rows for that node.  
  
```  
--Run this in a different session than the session in which your query is running. 
--Note that you may need to change session id 54 below with the session id you want to monitor.
SELECT node_id,physical_operator_name, SUM(row_count) row_count, 
  SUM(estimate_row_count) AS estimate_row_count, 
  CAST(SUM(row_count)*100 AS float)/SUM(estimate_row_count)  
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_profiles   
WHERE session_id=54
GROUP BY node_id,physical_operator_name  
ORDER BY node_id;  
```
