  Stores history details for log shipping jobs. This table is stored in the **msdb** database.  
  
 The tables related to history and monitoring are also used at the primary server and the secondary servers.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**agent_id**|**uniqueidentifier**|The primary ID for backup or the secondary ID for copy or restore.|  
|**agent_type**|**tinyint**|The type of log shipping job.<br /><br /> 0 = Backup.<br /><br /> 1 = Copy.<br /><br /> 2 = Restore.|  
|**session_id**|**int**|The session ID for the backup/copy/restore/ job.|  
|**database_name**|**sysname**|The name of the database associated with this record. Primary database for backup, secondary database for restore, or empty for copy.|  
|**session_status**|**tinyint**|The status of the session.<br /><br /> 0 = Starting.<br /><br /> 1 = Running.<br /><br /> 2 = Success.<br /><br /> 3 = Error.<br /><br /> 4 = Warning.|  
|**log_time**|**datetime**|The date and time at which the record was created.|

|**message**|**nvarchar(max)**|Message text.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This table contains history details for the log shipping agents. To identify an agent session, use columns **agent_id**, **agent_type**, and **session_id**. To see the history detail for the agent session, sort by **log_time**.  
  
 In addition to being stored on the remote monitor server, the information related to the primary server is stored on the primary server in its **log_shipping_monitor_history_detail** table, and information related to a secondary server is also stored on the secondary server in its **log_shipping_monitor_history_detail** table.
