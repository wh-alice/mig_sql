# Create Clustered DTC for an Always On Availability Group
This topic walks you through a complete configuration of a clustered DTC resource for a SQL Server Always On Availability Group. The complete configuration can take up to an hour to complete. 

The walkthrough creates a clustered DTC resource and the SQL Server Availability Groups to align with the requirements at [Cluster DTC for SQL Server Availability Groups](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/cluster-dtc-for-sql-server-2016-availability-groups.md).

The walkthrough uses PowerShell and Transact-SQL (T-SQL) scripts.  Many of the T-SQL scripts require **SQLCMD Mode** to be enabled.  For more information on **SQLCMD Mode**, see [Enable SQLCMD Scripting in Query Editor](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174187.aspx#Anchor_1).  The PowerShell module **FailoverClusters** must be imported.  For more information of importing a PowerShell module, see [Importing a PowerShell Module](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd878284(v=vs.85).aspx).  This walkthrough is based on the following:
- All requirements from [Prerequisites, Restrictions, and Recommendations for Always On Availability Groups (SQL Server)](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/prereqs-restrictions-recommendations-always-on-availability.md) have been met.  
- The domain is `contoso.lab`.
- The user has the Create Computer objects permission in the OU where the DTC Network Name resource will be created.
- The user is a domain user who has administrator rights on all nodes in the cluster.
- A file share called `sqlbackups` has been created for backups.
- The default instances of SQL Server are named `SQLNODE1` and `SQLNODE2`.
- The same service account is used on all instances of SQL Server.
- The user is a member of the fixed SQL Server role sysadmin on all instances of SQL Server.
- The default outcome of transactions that DTC is unable to resolve will be set to `presume commit`.
- The mirroring endpoint will use port `5022`.
- No other Availability Groups or clustered DTC resources exist.
- Cluster details (Existing):
  - Name: `Cluster`
  - Network Name: `Cluster Network 1`
  - Nodes: `SQLNODE1, SQLNODE2`
  - Shared storage: `Cluster Disk 3` (Owned by `SQLNODE1`)
- Cluster details (To be created):
  - Network Name resource: `DTCnet1`
  - DTC Network Name resource:  `DTC1`
  - DTC Physical Disk resource: `DTCDisk1`
  - DTC IP and subnet resource: `192.168.2.54`, `255.255.255.0`
  - DTC IP resource: `DTCIP1`

## 1. Check operating system
For supported distributed transactions, [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] must be running on Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2012 R2.  For Windows Server 2012 R2, you must install the update in KB3090973 available at [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3090973](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3090973).  This script will check the operating system version and whether hotfix 3090973 needs to be installed.  Run the following PowerShell Script on `SQLNODE1`.

```powershell  
# A few OS checks

<#
Script: 
    1) is re-runnable 
    2) will work on any node in the cluster, and 
    3) will execute against every node in the cluster
#>

$nodes = (Get-ClusterNode).Name;
foreach ($node in $nodes) {

    # At least 2012 R2
    $os = (Get-WmiObject -class Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName $node).caption;
    IF($os -like "*2012 R2*" -or $os -like "*2016*")
    {
        Write-Host "$os is supported on $node.";
    }
    ELSE
    {
        Write-Host "STOP!  $os is not supported on $node.";
    }
    
    # KB 3090973
    IF($os -like "*2012 R2*")
    {
        $kb = Get-Hotfix -ComputerName $node | Where {$_.HotFixID -eq 'KB3090973'};
        IF($kb)
        {
            Write-Host "KB3090973 is installed on $node."
        }
        ELSE
        {
            Write-Host "HotFixID KB3090973 must be applied on $node.  See https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3090973 for additional information and to download the hotfix.";
        }
    }
    ELSE
    {
        Write-Host "KB3090973 is not applicable to $os on $node."
    }
}
```  
## 2.   Configure firewall rules
This script will configure the firewall to allow DTC traffic, on each SQL Server hosting an availability group replica, as well as any other server engaging in the distributed transaction.  The script will also configure the firewall to allow connections for the database mirroring endpoint.  Run the following PowerShell Script on `SQLNODE1`.

```powershell  
# Configure Firewall

<#
Script: 
    1) is re-runnable 
    2) will work on any node in the cluster, and 
    3) will execute against every node in the cluster
#>

$nodes = (Get-ClusterNode).Name;
foreach ($node in $nodes) {
    Get-NetFirewallRule -CimSession $node -DisplayGroup 'Distributed Transaction Coordinator' -Enabled False -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Enable-NetFirewallRule;
    New-NetFirewallRule -CimSession $node -DisplayName 'SQL Server Mirroring' -Description 'Port 5022 for SQL Server Mirroring' -Action Allow -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5022 -RemotePort Any -LocalAddress Any -RemoteAddress Any;
    };
```  
## 3.  Configure **in-doubt xact resolution** 
This script will configure the **in-doubt xact resolution** server configuration option to “presume commit” for in-doubt transactions.  Run the following T-SQL script in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) against `SQLNODE1` in **SQLCMD mode**.

```tsql  
/*******************************************************************
	Execute script in its entirety on SQLNODE1 in SQLCMD mode
*******************************************************************/

-- Configure in-doubt xact resolution on all SQL Server instances to presume commit
IF (SELECT CAST(value_in_use as bit) FROM sys.configurations WITH (NOLOCK) WHERE [name] = N'show advanced options') = 0
BEGIN	
	EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
	RECONFIGURE;
END

-- Configure the server to presume commit for in-doubt transactions.
IF (SELECT CAST(value as bit) FROM sys.configurations WITH (NOLOCK) WHERE [name] = N'in-doubt xact resolution') <> 1
BEGIN	
	EXEC sp_configure 'in-doubt xact resolution', 1;
	RECONFIGURE;
END
GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

:connect SQLNODE2
IF (SELECT CAST(value_in_use as bit) FROM sys.configurations WITH (NOLOCK) WHERE [name] = N'show advanced options') = 0
BEGIN	
	EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
	RECONFIGURE;
END

-- Configure the server to presume commit for in-doubt transactions.
IF (SELECT CAST(value as bit) FROM sys.configurations WITH (NOLOCK) WHERE [name] = N'in-doubt xact resolution') <> 1
BEGIN	
	EXEC sp_configure 'in-doubt xact resolution', 1;
	RECONFIGURE;
END
GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## 4. Create test databases
The script will create a database named `AG1` on `SQLNODE1` and a database named `dtcDemoAG1` on `SQLNODE2`.  Run the following T-SQL script in SSMS against `SQLNODE1` in **SQLCMD mode**.

```tsql  
/*******************************************************************
	Execute script in its entirety on SQLNODE1 in SQLCMD mode
*******************************************************************/

-- On SQLNODE1 
USE master;
SET NOCOUNT ON;

IF  EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.databases WHERE name = N'AG1')
BEGIN
	DROP DATABASE AG1;
END
GO

CREATE DATABASE AG1;
ALTER DATABASE AG1 SET RECOVERY FULL WITH NO_WAIT;
ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON DATABASE::AG1 to sa;
GO

USE AG1;
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Names] (
        [Name] [varchar](64) NULL,
		[EditDate] datetime
		);

INSERT Names
VALUES ('AG1', GETDATE());
GO


-- Against SQNODE2
:connect SQLNODE2
USE master;
SET NOCOUNT ON;

IF  EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.databases WHERE name = N'dtcDemoAG1')
BEGIN
	DROP DATABASE dtcDemoAG1;
END
GO

CREATE DATABASE dtcDemoAG1;
ALTER DATABASE dtcDemoAG1 SET RECOVERY SIMPLE WITH NO_WAIT;
ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON DATABASE::dtcDemoAG1 to sa;
GO

USE dtcDemoAG1;
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Names] (
        [Name] [varchar](64) NULL,
		[EditDate] datetime
		);
GO    
----------------------------------------------------------------
```
## 5.	Create Endpoints
This script will create an endpoint called `AG1_endpoint` that listens on TCP port `5022`.  Run the following T-SQL script in SSMS against `SQLNODE1` in **SQLCMD mode**.

```tsql  
/**********************************************
Execute on SQLNODE1 in SQLCMD mode
**********************************************/

-- Create endpoint on server instance that hosts the primary replica:
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_mirroring_endpoints)
BEGIN
	CREATE ENDPOINT AG1_endpoint
	AUTHORIZATION [sa]
		STATE=STARTED 
		AS TCP (LISTENER_PORT=5022) 
		FOR DATABASE_MIRRORING (ROLE=ALL);
END
GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

:connect SQLNODE2
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_mirroring_endpoints)
BEGIN
	CREATE ENDPOINT AG1_endpoint
	AUTHORIZATION [sa]
		STATE=STARTED 
		AS TCP (LISTENER_PORT=5022) 
		FOR DATABASE_MIRRORING (ROLE=ALL);
END
GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## 6.	Prepare databases for Availability Group
The script will back up `AG1` on `SQLNODE1` and restore it to `SQLNODE2`.  Run the following T-SQL script in SSMS against `SQLNODE1` in **SQLCMD mode**.

```tsql  
/*******************************************************************
	Execute script in its entirety on SQLNODE1 in SQLCMD mode
*******************************************************************/

-- Backup database
BACKUP DATABASE AG1 
TO DISK = N'\\sqlnode1\sqlbackups\AG1.bak' 
WITH FORMAT, STATS = 10;

-- Backup transaction log
BACKUP LOG AG1
TO DISK = N'\\sqlnode1\sqlbackups\AG1_Log.bak'
WITH FORMAT, STATS = 10;
GO


-- Restore database and logs on secondary WITH NORECOVERY
:connect SQLNODE2
USE [master]
RESTORE DATABASE AG1 
FROM DISK = N'\\sqlnode1\sqlbackups\AG1.bak' 
WITH NORECOVERY, STATS = 10;

RESTORE LOG AG1 
FROM DISK = N'\\sqlnode1\sqlbackups\AG1_Log.bak'
WITH NORECOVERY, STATS = 10;
GO
```

## 7.	Create Availability Group
[!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)] must be created with the **CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP** command and the **WITH DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB** clause.  You cannot currently alter an existing Availability Group.  The New Availability Group wizard does not allow you to enable DTC support for a new Availability Group.  The following script will create the new Availability Group and join the secondary.  Run the following T-SQL script in SSMS against `SQLNODE1` in **SQLCMD mode**.

```tsql  
/*******************************************************************
	Execute script in its entirety on SQLNODE1 in SQLCMD mode
*******************************************************************/

--  Create Availability Group on SQLNODE1 
USE master;
CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP DTCAG1
WITH (DTC_SUPPORT = PER_DB) 
FOR DATABASE AG1
REPLICA ON 
  'SQLNODE1' WITH
     (
     ENDPOINT_URL = 'TCP://SQLNODE1.contoso.lab:5022', 
     AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
     FAILOVER_MODE = MANUAL
     ),
  'SQLNODE2' WITH 
     (
     ENDPOINT_URL = 'TCP://SQLNODE2.contoso.lab:5022',
     AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
     FAILOVER_MODE = MANUAL
     ); 
GO


-- SQLNODE2
-- Join secondary replica to the Availability Group 
:connect SQLNODE2
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP DTCag1 JOIN;

-- Join database to the Availability Group
ALTER DATABASE AG1 SET HADR AVAILABILITY GROUP = DTCAG1;
GO
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
You cannot Enable DTC on an existing [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/includes/sshadr-md.md)].  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will accept the following syntax for an existing Availability Group:  
>
> USE master;    
> ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP \<availability_group\>  
SET (DTC_Support = Per_DB)  
>
>However, no configuration change will actually be made.  You can confirm the **dtc_support** configuration with the following T-SQL query:  
>
>SELECT name, dtc_support FROM sys.availability_groups  
>
>The only way to enable DTC support on an Availability Group is by creating an Availability Group using Transact-SQL.
 
## <a name="ClusterDTC"></a>8.	Prepare cluster resources

This script will prepare the DTC dependent resources: Disk and IP.  The shared storage will be added to the Windows Cluster.  Network resources will be created and then the DTC will be created and made as a resource to the Availability Group.  Run the following PowerShell Script on `SQLNODE1`.

```powershell  
# Create a clustered Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator properly in the resource group with SQL Server

<#----------------------------------- Begin User Input -----------------------------------#>
$AGgrp = "DTCag1";							# Name of the WSFC resource group that will contain the DTC resource

$WSFC = (Get-Cluster).Name;					# Windows Failover Cluster name
$DTCnetwk = "Cluster Network 1"				# WSFC Network to use for the DTC IP address

$ClusterAvailableDisk = "Cluster Disk 3";	# Designated disk that can support failover clustering and is visible to all nodes, but not yet part of the set of clustered disks
$DTCdisk = "DTCDisk1";						# Name of the disk to be used with DTC

$DTCipresnm = "DTCIP1";						# WSFC Friendly Name of the DTC's IP resource 
$DTCipaddr = "192.168.2.54";				# IP address of the DTC resource 
$DTCsubnet = "255.255.255.0";				# Subnet for the DTC IP address 
$DTCnetnm = "DTCNet1";						# WSFC Friendly Name of the Network Name resource
$DTCresnm = "DTC1";							# Name of the WSFC DTC Network Name resource; Name must be unique in AD
<#------------------------------------ End User Input ------------------------------------#>


# Make a new disk available for use in a failover cluster.
Get-ClusterAvailableDisk | Where {$_.Name -eq $ClusterAvailableDisk} | Add-ClusterDisk;

# Rename disk
$resource = Get-ClusterResource $ClusterAvailableDisk; $resource.Name = $DTCdisk;

# Create the IP resource
Add-ClusterResource -Name $DTCipresnm -ResourceType "IP Address" -Group $AGgrp;

# Set the network to use, IP address, and subnet
# All three have to be configured at the same time
$DTCIPres = Get-ClusterResource $DTCipresnm;
$ntwk = New-Object Microsoft.FailoverClusters.PowerShell.ClusterParameter $DTCipres,Network,$DTCnetwk;
$ipaddr = New-Object Microsoft.FailoverClusters.PowerShell.ClusterParameter $DTCipres,Address,$DTCipaddr;
$subnet = New-Object Microsoft.FailoverClusters.PowerShell.ClusterParameter $DTCipres,SubnetMask,$dtcsubnet;

$setdtcipparams = $ntwk,$ipaddr,$subnet;
$setdtcipparams | Set-ClusterParameter;

# Create the Network Name resource
Add-ClusterResource $DTCnetnm -ResourceType "Network Name" -Group $AGgrp;

# Set the value for the Network Name resource
Get-ClusterResource $DTCnetnm | Set-ClusterParameter DnsName $DTCresnm;

# Add the IP address as a depenency of the Network Name resource
Add-ClusterResourceDependency $DTCnetnm $DTCipresnm;

# Create the Distributed Transaction Coordinator resource
Add-ClusterResource $DTCresnm -ResourceType "Distributed Transaction Coordinator" -Group $AGgrp;

# Add the Network Name as a depenency of the DTC resource
Add-ClusterResourceDependency $DTCresnm $DTCnetnm;

# Move the disk into the resource group with SQL Server
Move-ClusterResource -Name $DTCdisk -Group $AGgrp;

# Add the disk as a depenency of the DTC resource
Add-ClusterResourceDependency $DTCresnm $DTCdisk;

# Bring the IP resource online
Start-ClusterResource $DTCipresnm;

# Bring the Network Name resource online
Start-ClusterResource $DTCnetnm;

# Bring the DTC resource online
Start-ClusterResource $DTCresnm;
```  

## 9.	Enable Network DTC 

The following script will enable Network DTC Access for the clustered DTC service to allow remote computers to enlist in distributed transactions over the network.  Run the following PowerShell Script on `SQLNODE1`.

```powershell  
# Enable Network DTC access for the clustered DTC service

<#
Script: 
    1) is re-runnable 
    2) will work on any node in the cluster, and 
    3) will execute against every node in the cluster
#>

# Enter Name of DTC resource

$DtcName = "DTC1";
<# ------- End of User Input ------- #>

[bool]$restart = 0;
$node = (Get-ClusterResource -Name $DtcName).OwnerNode.Name;
$DtcSettings = Get-DtcNetworkSetting -DtcName $DtcName;

IF ($DtcSettings.InboundTransactionsEnabled -eq $false)   
{
    Set-DtcNetworkSetting -CimSession $node -DtcName $DtcName -AuthenticationLevel "Mutual" -InboundTransactionsEnabled $true -Confirm:$false;
    $restart = 1;
}

IF ($DtcSettings.OutboundTransactionsEnabled -eq $false)   
{
    Set-DtcNetworkSetting -CimSession $node -DtcName $DtcName -AuthenticationLevel "Mutual" -OutboundTransactionsEnabled $true -Confirm:$false;
    $restart = 1;
}

IF ($restart -eq 1)
{
    Stop-Dtc -CimSession $node -DtcName $DTCname -Confirm:$false;
    Start-Dtc -CimSession $node -DtcName $DTCname;
}
```  

## 10.	Disable and stop the local DTC service on each node

In order to guarantee that distributed transactions use the clustered DTC resource, disable the local DTC on both nodes.  The following script will disable and stop the local DTC service on each node.  Run the following PowerShell Script on `SQLNODE1`.
```powershell  
# Disble local DTC service

<#
Script: 
    1) is re-runnable 
    2) will work on any node in the cluster, and 
    3) will execute against every node in the cluster
#>

$DTCname = 'Local';
$nodes = (Get-ClusterNode).Name;

 foreach ($node in $nodes) {

    $service = Get-WmiObject -class Win32_Service -computername $node -Filter "Name='MSDTC'";
    IF ($service.StartMode -ne 'Disabled')
    {
        $service.ChangeStartMode('Disabled');
    }
    
    IF ($service.State -ne 'Stopped')
    {
        $service.StopService();
    }
}
```  

## 11.	Cycle the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service for each instance

With the clustered DTC service completely configured, you need to stop and restart each instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in the Availability Group in order to make sure [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is enrolled to use this DTC service.

The first time [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service requires a distributed transaction, it enrolls with a DTC service. SQL Server service will continue to use that DTC service until it is restarted. If a clustered DTC service is available, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will enroll with the clustered DTC service. If a clustered DTC service is not available, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will enroll with the local DTC service. In order to verify that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] enrolls with the clustered DTC service, stop and restart each instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. 

Follow the steps contained in the T-SQL script below:
```tsql  
/*
Gracefully cycle the SQL Server service and failover the Availability Group
	a.	On SQLNODE2, cycle the SQL Server service from SQL Server Configuration Manger

	b.	On SQLNODE2 failover the Availability Group to SQLNODE2
		Execute T-SQL script, below, on SQLNODE2 (Use Results to Text)

	c.	On SQLNODE1, cycle the SQL Server service from SQL Server Configuration Manger

	d.	On SQLNODE1 failover the Availability Group to SQLNODE1 once the databases are back in sync.
		Execute T-SQL script, below, on SQLNODE1 (Use Results to Text)
*/

SET NOCOUNT ON;

-- Ensure replica is secondary
IF (
SELECT rs.is_primary_replica 
	FROM sys.availability_groups ag
	JOIN sys.dm_hadr_database_replica_states rs
	ON	ag.group_id = rs.group_id
	WHERE ag.name = N'DTCag1'
	AND rs.is_local = 1) = 0
BEGIN
	-- Wait for SYNCHRONIZED state
	DECLARE @ctr tinyint = 0;
	declare @msg varchar(128);
	WHILE (SELECT synchronization_state 
		FROM sys.availability_groups ag
		JOIN sys.dm_hadr_database_replica_states rs
		ON	ag.group_id = rs.group_id
		WHERE ag.name = N'DTCag1'
		AND rs.is_primary_replica = 0
		AND rs.is_local = 1) <> 2
	BEGIN
		WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:01'
		SET @ctr += 1
		SET @msg = 'Waiting for databases to become synchronized. Duration in seconds: ' + cast(@ctr AS varchar(3))
		RAISERROR (@msg, 0, 1) WITH NOWAIT
	END

	ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP DTCAG1 FAILOVER;
	SELECT 'Failover complete' AS [Sucess]
END
ELSE BEGIN
	SELECT 'This instance is the primary replica.  Connect to the secondary replica and try again.' AS [Error]
END

```

## 12.	Test Configuration

This test uses a linked server from `SQLNODE1` to `SQLNODE2` to create a distributed transaction.  Ensure the Availability Group primary replica is on `SQLNODE1`. To test the configuration you will:

- Create linkes servers
- Execute a distributed transaction

### Create linked servers  
The following script will create two linked servers on `SQLNODE1`.  Run the following T-SQL script in SSMS against `SQLNODE1`.

```tsql  
-- SQLNODE1
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.servers where name = N'SQLNODE1')
BEGIN
	EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedserver @server = N'SQLNODE1';	
END

IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.servers where name = N'SQLNODE2')
BEGIN
	EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedserver @server = N'SQLNODE2';	
END
 ```

### Execute a distributed transaction
This script will first return the current DTC transaction statistics.  Then the script will execute a distributed transaction utilizing databases on `SQLNODE1` and `SQLNODE2`.  Then the script will again return the DTC transaction statics which will now should an increased count.  Physically connect to `SQLNODE1` and run the following T-SQL Script in SSSMS against `SQLNODE1` in **SQLCMD mode**.

```tsql  
/*******************************************************************
	Execute script in its entirety on SQLNODE1 in SQLCMD mode
	Must be physically connected to SQLNODE1
*******************************************************************/

USE AG1;
SET NOCOUNT ON;

-- Get Baseline
!! Powershell; $DtcNameC = Get-DtcClusterDefault; Get-DtcTransactionsStatistics -DtcName $DtcNameC;

SET XACT_ABORT ON
BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION
	INSERT INTO SQLNODE1.[AG1].[dbo].[Names] VALUES ('TestValue1', GETDATE());
	INSERT INTO SQLNODE2.[dtcDemoAG1].[dbo].[Names] VALUES ('TestValue2', GETDATE());
COMMIT TRAN
GO

-- Review DTC Transaction Statistics
!! Powershell; $DtcNameC = Get-DtcClusterDefault; Get-DtcTransactionsStatistics -DtcName $DtcNameC;
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `USE AG1` statement must be executed to ensure the database context is set to `AG1`.  Otherwise, you will receive the following error message: “Transaction context in use by another session.”
