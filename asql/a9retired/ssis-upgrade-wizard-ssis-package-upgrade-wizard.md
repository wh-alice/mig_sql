  Use the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Package Upgrade Wizard to migrate packages that were developed in [!INCLUDE[ssISversion2005](../a9retired/includes/ssisversion2005-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssISversion10](../a9retired/includes/ssisversion10-md.md)] to the package format that the current release of [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] uses.
