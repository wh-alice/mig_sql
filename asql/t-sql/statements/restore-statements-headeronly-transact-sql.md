# RESTORE Statements - HEADERONLY (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns a result set containing all the backup header information for all backup sets on a particular backup device in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For the descriptions of the arguments, see [RESTORE Arguments &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/restore-statements-arguments-transact-sql.md).

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
RESTORE HEADERONLY   
FROM <backup_device>   
[ WITH   
 {  
--Backup Set Options  
   FILE = { backup_set_file_number | @backup_set_file_number }   
 | PASSWORD = { password | @password_variable }   
  
--Media Set Options  
 | MEDIANAME = { media_name | @media_name_variable }   
 | MEDIAPASSWORD = { mediapassword | @mediapassword_variable }  
  
--Error Management Options  
 | { CHECKSUM | NO_CHECKSUM }   
 | { STOP_ON_ERROR | CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR }  
  
--Tape Options  
 | { REWIND | NOREWIND }   
 | { UNLOAD | NOUNLOAD }    
 } [ ,...n ]  
]  
[;]  
  
<backup_device> ::=  
{   
   { logical_backup_device_name |  
      @logical_backup_device_name_var }  
   | { DISK | TAPE } = { 'physical_backup_device_name' |  
       @physical_backup_device_name_var }   
}  
  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 For descriptions of the RESTORE HEADERONLY arguments, see [RESTORE Arguments &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/restore-statements-arguments-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Result Sets  
 For each backup on a given device, the server sends a row of header information with the following columns:  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  RESTORE HEADERONLY looks at all backup sets on the media. Therefore, producing this result set when using high-capacity tape drives can take some time. To get a quick look at the media without getting information about every backup set, use RESTORE LABELONLY or specify FILE **=** *backup_set_file_number*.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Due to the nature of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Tape Format, it is possible for backup sets from other software programs to occupy space on the same media as [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] backup sets. The result set returned by RESTORE HEADERONLY includes a row for each of these other backup sets.

|**HasIncompleteMetaData**|**bit**|**1** = A tail-log backup with incomplete meta-data.<br /><br /> For information about tail-log backups with incomplete backup metadata, see [Tail-Log Backups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/tail-log-backups-sql-server.md).|

|**IsCopyOnly**|**bit**|**1** = A copy-only backup.<br /><br /> A copy-only backup does not impact the overall backup and restore procedures for the database. For more information, see [Copy-Only Backups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/copy-only-backups-sql-server.md).|

For more information, see [RESTORE FILELISTONLY &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/restore-statements-filelistonly-transact-sql.md).<br /><br /> For non-differential backup types, the value is always NULL.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Differential Backups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/differential-backups-sql-server.md).|

|**BackupSetGUID**|**uniqueidentifier** NULL|Unique identification number of the backup set, by which it is identified on the media.|  
|**CompressedBackupSize**|**bigint**|Byte count of the backup set. For uncompressed backups, this value is the same as **BackupSize**.<br /><br /> To calculate the compression ratio, use **CompressedBackupSize** and **BackupSize**.<br /><br /> During an **msdb** upgrade, this value is set to match the value of the **BackupSize** column.|  
|**containment**|**tinyint** not NULL|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../a9notintoc/includes/sscurrent-md.md)].<br /><br /> Indicates the containment status of the database.<br /><br /> 0 = database containment is off<br /><br /> 1 = database is in partial containment|  
|**KeyAlgorithm**|**nvarchar(32)**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql14-md.md)] (CU1) through current version.<br /><br /> The encryption algorithm used to encrypt the backup. NO_Encryption indicates that the backup was not encrypted. When the correct value cannot be determined the value should be NULL.|  
|**EncryptorThumbprint**|**varbinary(20)**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql14-md.md)] (CU1) through current version.<br /><br /> The thumbprint of the encryptor which can be used to find certificate or the asymmetric key in the database. When the backup was not encrypted, this value is NULL.|  
|**EncryptorType**|**nvarchar(32)**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../a9notintoc/includes/sssql14-md.md)] (CU1) through current version.<br /><br /> The type of encryptor used: Certificate or Asymmetric Key. When the backup was not encrypted, this value is NULL.|  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If passwords are defined for the backup sets, RESTORE HEADERONLY shows complete information for only the backup set whose password matches the specified PASSWORD option of the command. RESTORE HEADERONLY also shows complete information for unprotected backup sets. The **BackupName** column for the other password-protected backup sets on the media is set to '***Password Protected\*\*\*', and all other columns are NULL.  
  
## General Remarks  
 A client can use RESTORE HEADERONLY to retrieve all the backup header information for all backups on a particular backup device. For each backup on the backup device, the server sends the header information as a row.  
  
## Security  
 A backup operation may optionally specify passwords for a media set, a backup set, or both. When a password has been defined on a media set or backup set, you must specify the correct password or passwords in the RESTORE statement. These passwords prevent unauthorized restore operations and unauthorized appends of backup sets to media using [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tools. However, a password does not prevent overwrite of media using the BACKUP statement's FORMAT option.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The protection provided by this password is weak. It is intended to prevent an incorrect restore using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tools by authorized or unauthorized users. It does not prevent the reading of the backup data by other means or the replacement of the password. [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)]The best practice for protecting backups is to store backup tapes in a secure location or back up to disk files that are protected by adequate access control lists (ACLs). The ACLs should be set on the directory root under which backups are created.  
  
### Permissions  
 Obtaining information about a backup set or backup device requires CREATE DATABASE permission. For more information, see [GRANT Database Permissions &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../Topic/GRANT%20Database%20Permissions%20\(Transact-SQL\).md).  
  
## Examples  
 The following example returns the information in the header for the disk file `C:\AdventureWorks-FullBackup.bak`.  
  
```  
RESTORE HEADERONLY   
FROM DISK = N'C:\AdventureWorks-FullBackup.bak'   
WITH NOUNLOAD;  
GO  
```
