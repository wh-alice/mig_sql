# Install SQL Server on Server Core
  You can install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a Server Core installation of [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] SP1 or [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/win8srv-md.md)]. This topic provides setup-specific details for installing [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] on Server Core.  
  
 The Server Core installation option for the [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/win8srv-md.md)] operating system provides a minimal environment for running specific server roles. This helps to reduce maintenance and management requirements and the attack surface for those server roles. For more information on Server Core as implemented on [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)], see [Server Core for Windows Server 2008 R2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=202439) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=202439). For more information on Server Core as implemented on [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/win8srv-md.md)], see [Server Core for Windows Server 2012](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh846323\(VS.85\).aspx) (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh846323(VS.85).aspx).  
  
## Prerequisites

     The following shows how you can launch Setup using a custom or default configuration file:  
  
    -   Launch setup using a custom configuration file:  
  
         To specify the configuration file at the command prompt:  
  
        ```  
        Setup.exe /QS /ConfigurationFile=MyConfigurationFile.INI  
        ```  
  
         To specify passwords at the command prompt instead of in the configuration file:  
  
        ```  
        Setup.exe /QS /SQLSVCPASSWORD="************" /ASSVCPASSWORD="************"  /ConfigurationFile=MyConfigurationFile.INI  
        ```  
  
    -   Launch setup using DefaultSetup.ini:  
  
         If you have the DefaultSetup.ini file in the \x86 and \x64 folders at the root level of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] source media, open the DefaultSetup.ini file, and then add the *Features* parameter to the file.  
  
         If the DefaultSetup.ini file does not exist, you can create it and copy it to the \x86 and \x64 folders at the root level of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] source media.  
  
## Configuring Remote Access of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Running on Server Core  
 Perform the actions described below to configure remote access of a [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] instance that is running on a Server Core installation of [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] SP1 or [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/win8srv-md.md)].  
  
### Enable remote connections on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  
 To enable remote connections, use SQLCMD.exe locally and execute the following statements against the Server Core instance:  
  
-   `EXEC sys.sp_configure N'remote access', N'1'`  
  
     `GO`  
  
-   `RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE`  
  
     `GO`  
  
### Enable and start the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service  
 By default, the Browser service is disabled.  If it is disabled on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] running on Server Core, run the following command from the command prompt to enable it:  
  
 `sc config SQLBROWSER start= auto`  
  
 After it is enabled, run the following command from the command prompt to start the service:  
  
 `net start SQLBROWSER`  
  
### Create exceptions in Windows Firewall  
 To create exceptions for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] access in Windows Firewall, follow the steps specified in [Configure the Windows Firewall to Allow SQL Server Access](../../../sql-server/install/configure-the-windows-firewall-to-allow-sql-server-access.md).  
  
### Enable TCP/IP on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  
 The TCP/IP protocol can be enabled through Windows PowerShell for an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Server Core. Follow these steps:  
  
1.  On the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] Server Core SP1 or [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/win8srv-md.md)] Server Core, launch Task Manager.  
  
2.  On the **Applications** tab, click **New Task**.  
  
3.  In the **Create New Task** dialog box, type **sqlps.exe** in the **Open** field and then click **OK**. This opens the **[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Powershell** window.  
  
4.  In the **Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Powershell** window, run the following script to enable the TCP/IP protocol:  
  
```  
$smo = 'Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.'  
$wmi = new-object ($smo + 'Wmi.ManagedComputer')  
# Enable the TCP protocol on the default instance.  If the instance is named, replace MSSQLSERVER with the instance name in the following line.  
$uri = "ManagedComputer[@Name='" + (get-item env:\computername).Value + "']/ServerInstance[@Name='MSSQLSERVER']/ServerProtocol[@Name='Tcp']"  
$Tcp = $wmi.GetSmoObject($uri)  
$Tcp.IsEnabled = $true  
$Tcp.Alter()  
$Tcp  
```  
  
## Uninstallation  
 After you log on to a computer that is running [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] Server Core SP1 or [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/includes/win8srv-md.md)] Server Core, you have a limited desktop environment with an Administrator command prompt. You can use this command prompt to initiate uninstallation of an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. To uninstall an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)], launch the uninstallation from the command prompt in full quiet mode by using the /Q parameter, or quiet simple mode by using the /QS parameter. The /QS parameter shows progress through the UI, but does not accept any input. /Q runs in a quiet mode without any user interface.  
  
 To uninstall an existing instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
```  
Setup.exe /Q /Action=Uninstall /FEATURES=SQLEngine,AS,IS /INSTANCENAME=MSSQLSERVER  
```  
  
 To remove a named instance, specify the name of the instance instead of "MSSQLSERVER" in the preceding example.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  If you accidentally close the command prompt, you can start a new command prompt by following these steps:  
>   
>  1.  Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to display Task Manager.  
> 2.  On the **Applications** tab, click **New Task**.  
> 3.  In the **Create New Task** dialog box, type **cmd** in the **Open** field and then [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)].
