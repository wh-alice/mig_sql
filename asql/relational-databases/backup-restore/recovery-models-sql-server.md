# Recovery Models (SQL Server)
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] backup and restore operations occur within the context of the recovery model of the database. Recovery models are designed to control transaction log maintenance. A *recovery model* is a database property that controls how transactions are logged, whether the transaction log requires (and allows) backing up, and what kinds of restore operations are available. Three recovery models exist: simple, full, and bulk-logged. Typically, a database uses the full recovery model or simple recovery model. A database can be switched to another recovery model at any time.

##  <a name="RMov"></a> Recovery Model Overview  
 The following table summarizes the three recovery models.  
  
|Recovery model|Description|Work loss exposure|Recover to point in time?|  
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|  
|**Simple**|No log backups.<br /><br /> Automatically reclaims log space to keep space requirements small, essentially eliminating the need to manage the transaction log space. For information about database backups under the simple recovery model, see [Full Database Backups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/full-database-backups-sql-server.md).<br /><br /> Operations that require transaction log backups are not supported by the simple recovery model. The following features cannot be used in simple recovery mode:<br /><br /> -Log shipping<br /><br /> -Always On or Database mirroring<br /><br /> -Media recovery without data loss<br /><br /> -Point-in-time restores|Changes since the most recent backup are unprotected. In the event of a disaster, those changes must be redone.|Can recover only to the end of a backup. For more information, see [Complete Database Restores &#40;Simple Recovery Model&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/complete-database-restores-simple-recovery-model.md). <br><br> For a more in depth explanation of the Simple recovery model, see [SQL Server Simple Recovery Model](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertutorial/4/sql-server-simple-recovery-model/) provided by the folks at [MSSQLTips!](https://www.mssqltips.com)|  
|**Full**|Requires log backups.<br /><br /> No work is lost due to a lost or damaged data file.<br /><br /> Can recover to an arbitrary point in time (for example, prior to application or user error). For information about database backups under the full recovery model, see [Full Database Backups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/full-database-backups-sql-server.md) and [Complete Database Restores &#40;Full Recovery Model&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/complete-database-restores-full-recovery-model.md).|Normally none.<br /><br /> If the tail of the log is damaged, changes since the most recent log backup must be redone.|Can recover to a specific point in time, assuming that your backups are complete up to that point in time. For information about using log backups to restore to the point of failure, see [Restore a SQL Server Database to a Point in Time &#40;Full Recovery Model&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-a-sql-server-database-to-a-point-in-time-full-recovery-model.md).<br /><br /> Note: If you have two or more full-recovery-model databases that must be logically consistent, you may have to implement special procedures to make sure the recoverability of these databases. For more information, see [Recovery of Related  Databases That Contain Marked Transaction](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/recovery-of-related-databases-that-contain-marked-transaction.md).|  
|**Bulk logged**|Requires log backups.<br /><br /> An adjunct of the full recovery model that permits high-performance bulk copy operations.<br /><br /> Reduces log space usage by using minimal logging for most bulk operations. For information about operations that can be minimally logged, see [The Transaction Log &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/logs/the-transaction-log-sql-server.md).<br /><br /> For information about database backups under the bulk-logged recovery model, see [Full Database Backups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/full-database-backups-sql-server.md) and [Complete Database Restores &#40;Full Recovery Model&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/complete-database-restores-full-recovery-model.md).|If the log is damaged or bulk-logged operations occurred since the most recent log backup, changes since that last backup must be redone.<br /><br /> Otherwise, no work is lost.|Can recover to the end of any backup. Point-in-time recovery is not supported.|
