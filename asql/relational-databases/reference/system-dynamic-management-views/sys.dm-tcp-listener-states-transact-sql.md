# sys.dm_tcp_listener_states (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns a row containing dynamic-state information for each TCP listener.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The availability group listener could listen to the same port as the listener of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. In this case, the listeners are listed separately, the same as for a Service Broker listener.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**listener_id**|**int**|Listener’s internal ID. Is not nullable.<br /><br /> Primary key.|  
|**ip_address**|**nvarchar48**|The listener IP address that is online and currently being listening to. Either IPv4 and IPv6 is allowed. If a listener possesses both types of addresses, they are listed separately. An IPv4 wildcard, is displayed as “0.0.0.0”. An IPv6 wildcard, is displayed as “::”.<br /><br /> Is not nullable.|  
|**is_ipv4**|**bit**|Type of IP address<br /><br /> 1 = IPv4<br /><br /> 0 = IPv6|  
|**port**|**int**|The port number on which the listener is listening. Is not nullable.|  
|**type**|**tinyint**|Listener type, one of:<br /><br /> 0 = [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)]<br /><br /> 1 = Service Broker<br /><br /> 2 = Database mirroring<br /><br /> Is not nullable.|  
|**type_desc**|**nvarchar(20)**|Description of the **type**, one of:<br /><br /> TSQL<br /><br /> SERVICE_BROKER<br /><br /> DATABASE_MIRRORING<br /><br /> Is not nullable.|  
|**state**|**tinyint**|State of the availability group listener, one of:<br /><br /> 1 = Online. The listener is listening and processing requests.<br /><br /> 2 = Pending restart. the listener is offline, pending a restart.<br /><br /> If the availability group listener is listening to the same port as the server instance, these two listeners always have the same state.<br /><br /> Is not nullable.<br /><br /> Note: The values in this column come from the TSD_listener object. The column does not support an offline state because when the TDS_listener is offline, it cannot be queried for state.|  
|**state_desc**|**nvarchar(16)**|Description of **state**, one of:<br /><br /> ONLINE<br /><br /> PENDING_RESTART<br /><br /> Is not nullable.|  
|**start_time**|**datetime**|Timestamp indicating when the listener was started. Is not nullable.|
