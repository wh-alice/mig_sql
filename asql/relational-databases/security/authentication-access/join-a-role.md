# Join a Role
  This topic describes how to assign roles to logins and database users in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)]. Use roles in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to efficiently manage permissions. Assign permissions to roles, and then add and remove users and logins to the roles. By using roles, permissions do not have to be individually maintained for each user.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports four types of roles.  
  
-   Fixed server roles  
  
-   User-defined server roles  
  
-   Fixed database roles  
  
-   User-defined database roles  
  
 The fixed roles are automatically available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Fixed roles have the necessary permissions to accomplish common tasks. For more information about fixed roles, see the following links. User-defined roles are created by you, and can be customized with the permissions that you select. For more information about user-defined roles, see the following links.
