# Maximum Capacity Specifications for SQL Server
  The following tables specify maximum sizes and numbers of various objects defined in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components. To navigate to the table for a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] technology, click on its link:

##  <a name="Engine"></a> [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] Objects  
 Maximum sizes and numbers of various objects defined in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases or referenced in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements.  
  
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] object||Maximum sizes/numbers [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (64-bit)|Additional Information|  
|---------------------------------------------------------|-|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|  
|Batch size||65,536 * Network Packet Size|Network Packet Size is the size of the tabular data stream (TDS) packets used to communicate between applications and the relational [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)]. The default packet size is 4 KB, and is controlled by the network packet size configuration option.|  
|Bytes per short string column||8,000||  
|Bytes per GROUP BY, ORDER BY||8,060||  
|Bytes per index key||900 bytes for a clustered index. 1,700 for a nonclustered index.|The maximum number of bytes in a clustered index key cannot exceed 900 in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For a nonclustered index key, the maximum is 1700 bytes.<br /><br /> You can define a key using variable-length columns whose maximum sizes add up to more than the limit. However, the combined sizes of the data in those columns can never exceed the limit.<br /><br /> In a nonclustered index, you can include extra non-key columns, and they do not count against the size limit of the key. The non-key columns might help some queries perform better.|  
|Bytes per index key for memory-optimized tables||2500 bytes for a nonclustered index. No limit for a hash index, as long as all index keys fit in-row.|On a memory-optimized table, a nonclustered index cannot have key columns whose maximum declared sizes exceed 2500 bytes. It is irrelevant whether the actual data in the key columns would be shorter than the maximum declared sizes.<br /><br /> For a hash index key there is no hard limit on size.<br /><br /> For indexes on memory-optimized tables, there is no concept of included columns, since all indexes inherently cover of all columns.<br /><br /> For a memory-optimized table, even though the row size is 8060 bytes, some variable-length columns can be physically stored outside those 8060 bytes. However, the maximum declared sizes of all key columns for all indexes on a table, plus any additional fixed-length columns in the table, must fit in the 8060 bytes.|  
|Bytes per foreign key||900||  
|Bytes per primary key||900||  
|Bytes per row||8,060|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports row-overflow storage which enables variable length columns to be pushed off-row. Only a 24-byte root is stored in the main record for variable length columns pushed out of row; because of this, the effective row limit is higher than in previous releases of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see the "Row-Overflow Data Exceeding 8 KB" topic in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.|  
|Bytes per row in memory-optimized tables||8,060|Starting [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../analysis-services/powershell/includes/sssql15-md.md)] memory-optimized tables support off-row storage. Variable length columns are pushed off-row if the maximum sizes for all the columns in the table exceeds 8060 bytes; this is a compile-time decision. Only an 8-byte reference is stored in-row for columns stored off-row. For more information, see [Table and Row Size in Memory-Optimized Tables](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/table-and-row-size-in-memory-optimized-tables.md).|  
|Bytes in source text of a stored procedure||Lesser of batch size or 250 MB||  
|Bytes per **varchar(max)**, **varbinary(max)**, **xml**, **text**, or **image** column||2^31-1||  
|Characters per **ntext** or **nvarchar(max)** column||2^30-1||  
|Clustered indexes per table||1||  
|Columns in GROUP BY, ORDER BY||Limited only by number of bytes||  
|Columns or expressions in a GROUP BY WITH CUBE or WITH ROLLUP statement||10||  
|Columns per index key||32|If the table contains one or more XML indexes, the clustering key of the user table is limited to 31 columns because the XML column is added to the clustering key of the primary XML index. In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can include nonkey columns in a nonclustered index to avoid the limitation of a maximum of 32 key columns. For more information, see [Create Indexes with Included Columns](../relational-databases/indexes/create-indexes-with-included-columns.md).|
