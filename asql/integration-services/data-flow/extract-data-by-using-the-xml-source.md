# Extract Data by Using the XML Source
  To add and configure an XML source, the package must already include at least one Data Flow task.  
  
### To extract data using an XML source  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  Click the **Data Flow** tab, and then, from the **Toolbox**, drag the XML source to the design surface.  
  
4.  Double-click the XML source.  
  
5.  In the **XML Source Editor**, on the **Connection Manager** page, select a data access mode:  
  
    -   For the **XML file location** access mode, click **Browse** and locate the folder that contains the XML file.  
  
    -   For the **XML file from variable** access mode, select the user-defined variable that contains the path of the XML file.  
  
    -   For the **XML data from variable** access mode, select the user-defined variable that contains the XML data.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The variables must be defined in the scope of the Data Flow task that contains the XML source, or in the scope of the package; additionally, the variable must have a string data type.  
  
6.  Optionally, select **Use inline schema** to indicate that the XML document includes schema information.  
  
7.  To specify an external XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema for the XML file, do one of the following:  
  
    -   Click **Browse** to locate an existing XSD file.  
  
    -   Click **Generate XSD** to create an XSD from the XML file.  
  
8.  To update the names of output columns, click **Columns** and edit the values in the **Output Column** list.  
  
9. To configure the error output, click **Error Output**. For more information, see [Configure an Error Output in a Data Flow Component](../../integration-services/troubleshooting/configure-an-error-output-in-a-data-flow-component.md).  
  
10. Click **OK**.  
  
11. To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.
