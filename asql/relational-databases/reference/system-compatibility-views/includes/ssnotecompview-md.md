  This SQL Server 2000 system table is included as a view for backward compatibility. We  recommend that you use the current SQL Server system views instead. To find the equivalent system view or views, see [Mapping System Tables to System Views &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../../relational-databases/reference/system-tables/mapping-system-tables-to-system-views-transact-sql.md). This feature will be removed in a future version of Microsoft SQL Server. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature.
