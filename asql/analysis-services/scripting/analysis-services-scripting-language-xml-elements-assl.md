# Analysis Services Scripting Language XML Elements (ASSL)
  Although the Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL) schema contains only XML elements, from a developer's point of view, these elements correspond to the following concepts:  
  
-   Objects, such as **Database**, **Cube**, and **Dimension** objects, in the hierarchy of objects contained by an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   Collections of objects, such as the **Dimensions** and **Cubes** collections.  
  
-   Properties, such as **Name** and **Description**, that describe objects.  
  
-   Data types, such as **Binding** and **Permission**, that are used to define the child elements and properties of other objects.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
