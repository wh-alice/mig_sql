# Select Parent Member Dialog Box (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the **Select Parent Member** dialog box in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to select a parent member for a calculated member. You can display the **Select Parent Member** dialog box by clicking **Change** in the **Calculated Member Form Editor** pane on the **Calculations** tab in Cube Designer.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In certain cases, such as when the hierarchy selected in **Tree** is defined for an attribute in which no (All) level is specified, there may be no parent member to select.  
  
## Options  
 **Tree**  
 Select the parent member to use for the calculated member.
