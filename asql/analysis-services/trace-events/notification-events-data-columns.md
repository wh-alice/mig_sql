# Notification Events Data Columns
  Notification events are events that are not directly caused by users of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. For example, notifications occur because of users updating underlying tables for proactive caching.  
  
 The Notifications Events event category has the following event class:  
  
|**Event ID**|**Event Name**|**Event Description**|  
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|  
|39|Notification|Notification event.|  
|40|User Defined|User defined Event.|  
  
 The following table lists the data columns for the event class.  
  
## Notification  
  
|**Column Name**|**Column Id**|**Column Type**|**Column Description**|  
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|  
|EventClass|0|1|Event Class is used to categorize events.|  
|EventSubclass|1|1|Event Subclass provides additional information about each event class.<br /><br /> The following **Sub Class Id**:<br />                      **Sub Class Name** pairs are defined:<br /><br /> 0: Proactive Caching Begin<br /><br /> 1: Proactive Caching End<br /><br /> 2: Flight Recorder Started<br /><br /> 3: Flight Recorder Stopped<br /><br /> 4: Configuration Properties Updated<br /><br /> 5: SQL Trace<br /><br /> 6: Object Created<br /><br /> 7: Object Deleted<br /><br /> 8: Object Altered<br /><br /> 9: Proactive Caching Polling Begin<br /><br /> 10: Proactive Caching Polling End<br /><br /> 11: Flight Recorder Snapshot Begin<br /><br /> 12: Flight Recorder Snapshot End<br /><br /> 13: Proactive Caching: notifiable object updated<br /><br /> 14: Lazy Processing: start processing<br /><br /> 15: Lazy Processing: processing complete<br /><br /> 16: SessionOpened Event Begin<br /><br /> 17: SessionOpened Event End<br /><br /> 18: SessionClosing Event Begin<br /><br /> 19: SessionClosing Event End<br /><br /> 20: CubeOpened Event Begin<br /><br /> 21: CubeOpened Event End<br /><br /> 22: CubeClosing Event Begin<br /><br /> 23: CubeClosing Event End<br /><br /> 24: Transaction abort requested|  
|CurrentTime|2|5|Contains the current time of the notification event, when available. For filtering, expected formats are 'YYYY-MM-DD' and 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.|  
|StartTime|3|5|Contains the time at which the event started, when available. For filtering, expected formats are 'YYYY-MM-DD' and 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.|  
|EndTime|4|5|Contains the time at which the event ended. This column is not populated for starting event classes, such as SQL:BatchStarting or SP:Starting. For filtering, expected formats are 'YYYY-MM-DD' and 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.|  
|Duration|5|2|Contains the amount of time (in milliseconds) taken by the event.|  
|IntegerData|10|1|Contains the integer data associated with the notification event. When the EventSubclass column is 8, values are:<br /><br /> 1 = Created<br /><br /> 2 = Deleted<br /><br /> 3 = Changed object's properties<br /><br /> 4 = Changed properties of the object's children<br /><br /> 6 = Children added<br /><br /> 7 = Children deleted<br /><br /> 8 = Object fully processed<br /><br /> 9 = Object partially processed<br /><br /> 10 = Object unprocessed<br /><br /> 11 = Object fully optimized<br /><br /> 12 = Object partially optimized<br /><br /> 13 = Object not optimized|  
|ObjectID|11|8|Contains the Object ID for which this notification is issued; this is a string value.|  
|ObjectType|12|1|Contains the object type associated with the notification event.|

|NTDomainName|33|8|Windows domain to which the user belongs.|  
|SessionID|39|8|Contains the session ID associated with the notification event.|  
|NTCanonicalUserName|40|8|Contains the Windows user name associated with the notification event. The user name is in canonical form. For example, engineering.microsoft.com/software/user.|
