# Creating an ODBC Destination with the Script Component
  In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)], you typically save data to an ODBC destination by using an [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../a9retired/includes/vstecado-md.md)] destination and the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../a9retired/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] Data Provider for ODBC. However, you can also create an ad hoc ODBC destination for use in a single package. To create this ad hoc ODBC destination, you use the Script component as shown in the following example.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to create a component that you can more easily reuse across multiple Data Flow tasks and multiple packages, consider using the code in this Script component sample as the starting point for a custom data flow component. For more information, see [Developing a Custom Data Flow Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/developing-a-custom-data-flow-component.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example demonstrates how to create a destination component that uses an existing ODBC connection manager to save data from the data flow into a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table.  
  
 This example is a modified version of the custom [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../a9retired/includes/vstecado-md.md)] destination that was demonstrated in the topic, [Creating a Destination with the Script Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting-data-flow-script-component-types/creating-a-destination-with-the-script-component.md). However, in this example, the custom [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../a9retired/includes/vstecado-md.md)] destination has been modified to work with an ODBC connection manager and save data to an ODBC destination. These modifications also include the following changes:  
  
-   You cannot call the **AcquireConnection** method of the ODBC connection manager from managed code, because it returns a native object. Therefore, this sample uses the connection string of the connection manager to connect to the data source directly by using the managed ODBC [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../a9retired/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] Data Provider.  
  
-   The **OdbcCommand** expects positional parameters. The positions of the parameters are indicated by the question marks (?) in the text of the command. (In contrast, a **SqlCommand** expects named parameters.)  
  
 This example uses the **Person.Address** table in the **AdventureWorks** sample database. The example passes the first and fourth columns, the **int*AddressID*** and **nvarchar(30)City** columns, of this table through the data flow. This same data is used in the source, transformation, and destination samples in the topic, [Developing Specific Types of Script Components](../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting-data-flow-script-component-types/developing-specific-types-of-script-components.md).  
  
#### To configure this Script Component example  
  
1.  Create an ODBC connection manager that connects to the **AdventureWorks** database.  
  
2.  Create a destination table by running the following Transact-SQL command in the **AdventureWorks** database:  
  
    ```  
    CREATE TABLE [Person].[Address2]([AddressID] [int] NOT NULL,  
        [City] [nvarchar](30) NOT NULL)  
    ```  
  
3.  Add a new Script component to the Data Flow designer surface and configure it as a destination.  
  
4.  Connect the output of an upstream source or transformation to the destination component in [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer. (You can connect a source directly to a destination without any transformations.) To ensure that this sample works, the output of the upstream component must include at least the **AddressID** and **City** columns from the **Person.Address** table of the **AdventureWorks** sample database.  
  
5.  Open the **Script Transformation Editor**. On the **Input Columns** page, select the **AddressID** and **City** columns.  
  
6.  On the **Inputs and Outputs** page, rename the input with a more descriptive name such as **MyAddressInput**.  
  
7.  On the **Connection Managers** page, add or create the ODBC connection manager with a descriptive name such as **MyODBCConnectionManager**.  
  
8.  On the **Script** page, click **Edit Script**, and then enter the script shown below in the **ScriptMain** class.  
  
9. Close the script development environment, close the **Script Transformation Editor**, and then run the sample.  
  
    ```vb#  
    Imports System.Data.Odbc  
    ...  
    Public Class ScriptMain  
        Inherits UserComponent

        Public Overrides Sub AcquireConnections(ByVal Transaction As Object)  
  
            Dim connectionString As String  
            connectionString = Me.Connections.MyODBCConnectionManager.ConnectionString  
            odbcConn = New OdbcConnection(connectionString)  
            odbcConn.Open()  
  
        End Sub  
  
        Public Overrides Sub PreExecute()  
  
            odbcCmd = New OdbcCommand("INSERT INTO Person.Address2(AddressID, City) " & _  
                "VALUES(?, ?)", odbcConn)  
            odbcParam = New OdbcParameter("@addressid", OdbcType.Int)  
            odbcCmd.Parameters.Add(odbcParam)  
            odbcParam = New OdbcParameter("@city", OdbcType.NVarChar, 30)  
            odbcCmd.Parameters.Add(odbcParam)  
  
        End Sub  
  
        Public Overrides Sub MyAddressInput_ProcessInputRow(ByVal Row As MyAddressInputBuffer)  
  
            With odbcCmd  
                .Parameters("@addressid").Value = Row.AddressID  
                .Parameters("@city").Value = Row.City  
                .ExecuteNonQuery()  
            End With  
  
        End Sub  
  
        Public Overrides Sub ReleaseConnections()  
  
            odbcConn.Close()  
  
        End Sub  
  
    End Class  
    ```  
  
    ```c#  
    using System.Data.Odbc;

        public override void AcquireConnections(object Transaction)  
        {  
  
            string connectionString;  
            connectionString = this.Connections.MyODBCConnectionManager.ConnectionString;  
            odbcConn = new OdbcConnection(connectionString);  
            odbcConn.Open();  
  
        }  
  
        public override void PreExecute()  
        {  
  
            odbcCmd = new OdbcCommand("INSERT INTO Person.Address2(AddressID, City) " +  
                "VALUES(?, ?)", odbcConn);  
            odbcParam = new OdbcParameter("@addressid", OdbcType.Int);  
            odbcCmd.Parameters.Add(odbcParam);  
            odbcParam = new OdbcParameter("@city", OdbcType.NVarChar, 30);  
            odbcCmd.Parameters.Add(odbcParam);  
  
        }  
  
        public override void MyAddressInput_ProcessInputRow(MyAddressInputBuffer Row)  
        {  
  
            {  
                odbcCmd.Parameters["@addressid"].Value = Row.AddressID;  
                odbcCmd.Parameters["@city"].Value = Row.City;  
                odbcCmd.ExecuteNonQuery();  
            }  
  
        }  
  
        public override void ReleaseConnections()  
        {  
  
            odbcConn.Close();  
  
        }  
    }  
    ```
