# sp_who (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Provides information about current users, sessions, and processes in an instance of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. The information can be filtered to return only those processes that are not idle, that belong to a specific user, or that belong to a specific session.  
  
||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [current version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299658)).|

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_who [ [ @loginame = ] 'login' | session ID | 'ACTIVE' ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@loginame =** ] **'***login***'** | *session ID* | **'ACTIVE'**  
 Is used to filter the result set.  
  
 *login* is **sysname** that identifies processes belonging to a particular login.  
  
 *session ID* is a session identification number belonging to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. *session ID* is **smallint**.  
  
 **ACTIVE** excludes sessions that are waiting for the next command from the user.  
  
 If no value is provided, the procedure reports all sessions belonging to the instance.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 0 (success) or 1 (failure)  
  
## Result Sets  
 **sp_who** returns a result set with the following information.  
  
|Column|Data type|Description|  
|------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**spid**|**smallint**|Session ID.|  
|**ecid**|**smallint**|Execution context ID of a given thread associated with a specific session ID.<br /><br /> ECID = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...*n*}, where 0 always represents the main or parent thread, and {1, 2, 3, ...*n*} represent the subthreads.|  
|**status**|**nchar(30)**|Process status. The possible values are:<br /><br /> **dormant**. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is resetting the session.<br /><br /> **running**. The session is running one or more batches. When Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS) is enabled, a session can run multiple batches. For more information, see [Using Multiple Active Result Sets &#40;MARS&#41;](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/using-multiple-active-result-sets-mars.md).<br /><br /> **background**. The session is running a background task, such as deadlock detection.<br /><br /> **rollback**. The session has a transaction rollback in process.<br /><br /> **pending**. The session is waiting for a worker thread to become available.<br /><br /> **runnable**. The session's task is in the runnable queue of a scheduler while waiting to get a time quantum.<br /><br /> **spinloop**. The session's task is waiting for a spinlock to become free.<br /><br /> **suspended**. The session is waiting for an event, such as I/O, to complete.|  
|**loginame**|**nchar(128)**|Login name associated with the particular process.|  
|**hostname**|**nchar(128)**|Host or computer name for each process.|  
|**blk**|**char(5)**|Session ID for the blocking process, if one exists. Otherwise, this column is zero.<br /><br /> When a transaction associated with a specified session ID is blocked by an orphaned distributed transaction, this column will return a '-2' for the blocking orphaned transaction.|  
|**dbname**|**nchar(128)**|Database used by the process.|  
|**cmd**|**nchar(16)**|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] command ([!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statement, internal [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] process, and so on) executing for the process.|  
|**request_id**|**int**|ID for requests running in a specific session.|  
  
 In case of parallel processing, subthreads are created for the specific session ID. The main thread is indicated as `spid = <xxx>` and `ecid =0`. The other subthreads have the same `spid = <xxx>`, but with **ecid** > 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 A blocking process, which may have an exclusive lock, is one that is holding resources that another process needs.  
  
 All orphaned distributed transactions are assigned the session ID value of '-2'. Orphaned distributed transactions are distributed transactions that are not associated with any session ID. For more information, see [Use Marked Transactions to Recover Related Databases Consistently &#40;Full Recovery Model&#41;](../../../relational-databases/backup-restore/use-marked-transactions-to-recover-related-databases-consistently.md).  
  
 Query the **is_user_process** column of sys.dm_exec_sessions to separate system processes from user processes.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires VIEW SERVER STATE permission on the server to see all executing sessions on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Otherwise, the user sees only the current session.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Listing all current processes  
 The following example uses `sp_who` without parameters to report all current users.  
  
```  
USE master;  
GO  
EXEC sp_who;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Listing a specific user's process  
 The following example shows how to view information about a single current user by login name.  
  
```  
USE master;  
GO  
EXEC sp_who 'janetl';  
GO  
```  
  
### C. Displaying all active processes  
  
```  
USE master;  
GO  
EXEC sp_who 'active';  
GO  
```  
  
### D. Displaying a specific process identified by a session ID  
  
```  
USE master;  
GO  
EXEC sp_who '10' --specifies the process_id;  
GO  
```
