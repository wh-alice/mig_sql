# Cluster Discrimination Tab (Mining Model Viewer)
  Use the **Cluster Discrimination** tab to compare two clusters that exist in a clustering model. You can see how different combinations of attributes and values are represented within the clusters.  
  
 **For More Information:** [Microsoft Clustering Algorithm](../analysis-services/data-mining/microsoft-clustering-algorithm.md), [Browse a Model Using the Microsoft Cluster Viewer](../analysis-services/data-mining/browse-a-model-using-the-microsoft-cluster-viewer.md)  
  
## Options  
 **Refresh viewer content**  
 Reload the mining model in the viewer.  
  
 **Mining Model**  
 Choose a mining model from those in the current mining structure. The mining model will open in its associated viewer.  
  
 **Viewer**  
 Choose a viewer to use to explore the selected mining model. You can use the custom viewer for clustering models, or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Mining Content Viewer. You can also use plug-in viewers if available.  
  
 **Cluster 1**  
 Select a cluster, so that you can compare it to another cluster.  
  
 **Cluster 2**  
 Select a second cluster from the list of clusters in the mining model, to compare to **Cluster 1**. You can also compare a cluster to its complement, meaning all cases in the model except those in the selected cluster.  
  
 **Discrimination scores for \<cluster 1> and \<cluster 2>**  
 The columns in the graph provide information about how each attribute-value pair is related to the two selected clusters.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|**Variables**|An attribute in the mining model.|  
|**Values**|A value of the attribute selected in **Variables**.|  
|**Favors \<cluster 1>**|The bar graph on the left represents the probability that the selected attribute-value pair is representative of the cluster selected in **Cluster 1**. You can pause the mouse over the bar to see the value, represented as a percentage. Note that even if the value is zero, it doesnâ€™t mean the attribute-value is necessarily missing from the cluster, just that the distribution strongly favors one cluster over the other.|  
|**Favors \<cluster 2>**|The bar graph on the right represents the probability that the selected attribute-value pair is representative of the cluster selected in **Cluster 2**.|
