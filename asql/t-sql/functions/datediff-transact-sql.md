# DATEDIFF (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns the count (signed integer) of the specified *datepart* boundaries crossed between the specified *startdate* and *enddate*.  
  
 For larger differences, see [DATEDIFF_BIG &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/functions/datediff-big-transact-sql.md). For an overview of all [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] date and time data types and functions, see [Date and Time Data Types and Functions &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/functions/date-and-time-data-types-and-functions-transact-sql.md).

## Syntax  
  
```  
-- Syntax for SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
DATEDIFF ( datepart , startdate , enddate )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *datepart*  
 Is the part of *startdate* and *enddate* that specifies the type of boundary crossed. The following table lists all valid *datepart* arguments. User-defined variable equivalents are not valid.  
  
|*datepart*|Abbreviations|  
|----------------|-------------------|  
|**year**|**yy, yyyy**|  
|**quarter**|**qq, q**|  
|**month**|**mm, m**|  
|**dayofyear**|**dy, y**|  
|**day**|**dd, d**|  
|**week**|**wk, ww**|  
|**hour**|**hh**|  
|**minute**|**mi, n**|  
|**second**|**ss, s**|  
|**millisecond**|**ms**|  
|**microsecond**|**mcs**|  
|**nanosecond**|**ns**|  
  
 *startdate*  
 Is an expression that can be resolved to a **time**, **date**, **smalldatetime**, **datetime**, **datetime2**, or **datetimeoffset** value. *date* can be an expression, column expression, user-defined variable or string literal. *startdate* is subtracted from *enddate*.  
  
 To avoid ambiguity, use four-digit years. For information about two digits years, see [Configure the two digit year cutoff Server Configuration Option](../../database-engine/configure/windows/configure-the-two-digit-year-cutoff-server-configuration-option.md).  
  
 *enddate*  
 See *startdate*.  
  
## Return Type  
 **int**  
  
## Return Value  
  
-   Each *datepart* and its abbreviations return the same value.  
  
 If the return value is out of range for **int** (-2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647), an error is returned. For **millisecond**, the maximum difference between *startdate* and *enddate* is 24 days, 20 hours, 31 minutes and 23.647 seconds. For **second**, the maximum difference is 68 years.  
  
 If *startdate* and *enddate* are both assigned only a time value and the *datepart* is not a time *datepart*, 0 is returned.  
  
 A time zone offset component of *startdate* or *endate* is not used in calculating the return value.  
  
 Because [smalldatetime](../../t-sql/data-types/smalldatetime-transact-sql.md) is accurate only to the minute, when a **smalldatetime** value is used for *startdate* or *enddate*, seconds and milliseconds are always set to 0 in the return value.  
  
 If only a time value is assigned to a variable of a date data type, the value of the missing date part is set to the default value: 1900-01-01. If only a date value is assigned to a variable of a time or date data type, the value of the missing time part is set to the default value: 00:00:00. If either *startdate* or *enddate* have only a time part and the other only a date part, the missing time and date parts are set to the default values.  
  
 If *startdate* and *enddate* are of different date data types and one has more time parts or fractional seconds precision than the other, the missing parts of the other are set to 0.  
  
## datepart Boundaries  
 The following statements have the same *startdate* and the same *endate*. Those dates are adjacent and differ in time by .0000001 second. The difference between the *startdate* and *endate* in each statement crosses one calendar or time boundary of its *datepart*. Each statement returns 1. If different years are used for this example and if both *startdate* and *endate* are in the same calendar week, the return value for **week** would be 0.

 `, '2006-01-01 00:00:00.0000000');`  
  
## Remarks  
 DATEDIFF can be used in the select list, WHERE, HAVING, GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses.  
  
 DATEDIFF implicitly casts string literals as a **datetime2** type. This means that DATEDIFF does not support the format YDM when the date is passed as a string. You must explicitly cast the string to a **datetime** or **smalldatetime** type to use the YDM format.  
  
 Specifying SET DATEFIRST has no effect on DATEDIFF. DATEDIFF always uses Sunday as the first day of the week to ensure the function is deterministic.  
  
## Examples  
 The following examples use different types of expressions as arguments for the *startdate* and *enddate* parameters.  
  
### A. Specifying columns for startdate and enddate  
 The following example calculates the number of day boundaries that are crossed between dates in two columns in a table.  
  
```  
CREATE TABLE dbo.Duration  
    (  
    startDate datetime2  
    ,endDate datetime2  
    );  
INSERT INTO dbo.Duration(startDate,endDate)  
    VALUES('2007-05-06 12:10:09','2007-05-07 12:10:09');  
SELECT DATEDIFF(day,startDate,endDate) AS 'Duration'  
FROM dbo.Duration;  
-- Returns: 1  
```  
  
### B. Specifying user-defined variables for startdate and enddate  
 The following example uses user-defined variables as arguments for *startdate* and *enddate*.  
  
```  
DECLARE @startdate datetime2 = '2007-05-05 12:10:09.3312722';  
DECLARE @enddate datetime2 = '2007-05-04 12:10:09.3312722';   
SELECT DATEDIFF(day, @startdate, @enddate);  
```  
  
### C. Specifying scalar system functions for startdate and enddate  
 The following example uses scalar system functions as arguments for *startdate* and *enddate*.  
  
```  
SELECT DATEDIFF(millisecond, GETDATE(), SYSDATETIME());  
```  
  
### D. Specifying scalar subqueries and scalar functions for startdate and enddate  
 The following example uses scalar subqueries and scalar functions as arguments for *startdate* and *enddate*.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT DATEDIFF(day,(SELECT MIN(OrderDate) FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader),  
    (SELECT MAX(OrderDate) FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader));  
```  
  
### E. Specifying constants for startdate and enddate  
 The following example uses character constants as arguments for *startdate* and *enddate*.  
  
```  
SELECT DATEDIFF(day, '2007-05-07 09:53:01.0376635'  
    , '2007-05-08 09:53:01.0376635');  
```  
  
### F. Specifying numeric expressions and scalar system functions for enddate  
 The following example uses a numeric expression, `(GETDATE ()+ 1)`, and scalar system functions, `GETDATE` and `SYSDATETIME`, as arguments for *enddate*.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT DATEDIFF(day, '2007-05-07 09:53:01.0376635', GETDATE()+ 1)   
    AS NumberOfDays  
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader;  
GO  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT DATEDIFF(day, '2007-05-07 09:53:01.0376635', DATEADD(day,1,SYSDATETIME())) AS NumberOfDays  
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader;  
GO  
```  
  
### G. Specifying ranking functions for startdate  
 The following example uses a ranking function as an argument for *startdate*.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName  
    ,DATEDIFF(day,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY   
        a.PostalCode),SYSDATETIME()) AS 'Row Number'  
FROM Sales.SalesPerson s   
    INNER JOIN Person.Person p   
        ON s.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID  
    INNER JOIN Person.Address a   
        ON a.AddressID = p.BusinessEntityID  
WHERE TerritoryID IS NOT NULL   
    AND SalesYTD <> 0;  
```  
  
### H. Specifying an aggregate window function for startdate  
 The following example uses an aggregate window function as an argument for *startdate*.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT soh.SalesOrderID, sod.ProductID, sod.OrderQty,soh.OrderDate  
    ,DATEDIFF(day,MIN(soh.OrderDate)   
        OVER(PARTITION BY soh.SalesOrderID),SYSDATETIME() ) AS 'Total'  
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail sod  
    INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh  
        ON sod.SalesOrderID = soh.SalesOrderID  
WHERE soh.SalesOrderID IN(43659,58918);  
GO  
```
