# Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL for XMLA)
  Applications communicate with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../analysis-services/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] using XML commands and object descriptions. Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL) represents the object definition language portion of this XML dialect.  
  
 This reference section contains syntax and usage information for each element in the ASSL schema.  
  
 Administrators and developers can refer to this reference section for help in understanding the scripts generated by [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../analysis-services/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], Analysis Management Objects (AMO), and other applications, or for help in creating or modifying scripts for their own purposes.
