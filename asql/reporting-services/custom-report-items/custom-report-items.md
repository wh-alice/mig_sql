# Custom Report Items
  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] provides a rich set of tools for building and publishing enterprise reports, managing security and subscriptions, and extending the reporting functionality through a comprehensive API. Reports are defined using an XML-based language called Report Definition Language (RDL). RDL provides a set of instructions that describe layout, query information, and item types for a report. It is possible to extend RDL by writing a custom report item. The custom report item consists of a run-time component, which is called by the report processor at run time, and a design-time component, which allows the custom report item to be available in Report Designer.  
  
 For a sample of a fully implemented custom report item, see [SQL Server Reporting Services Product Samples](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=177889).  
  
## Custom Report Item Scenarios  
 Developers who need to integrate [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] into their applications may require functionality that is not natively supported in RDL. This may include items such as: map controls, horizontal lists, columnar lists, and repivotable matrixes. A run-time custom report item component can be developed and distributed with an application to fill this need.  
  
 In addition to providing functionality that isnâ€™t natively supported, some developers may want to extend existing functionality with alternative versions of controls that are already included with [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. In this scenario, a developer could provide three components: a run-time component, a design-time component, and a design-time report item conversion component that converts an existing report item into a custom report item on demand.
