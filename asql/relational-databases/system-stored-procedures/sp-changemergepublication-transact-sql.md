```  
  
sp_changemergepublication [ @publication= ] 'publication'  
    [ , [ @property= ] 'property' ]  
    [ , [ @value= ] 'value' ]  
    [ , [ @force_invalidate_snapshot = ] force_invalidate_snapshot ]  
    [ , [ @force_reinit_subscription = ] force_reinit_subscription ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@publication=**] **'***publication***'**  
 The name of the publication. *publication* is **sysname**, with no default.  
  
 [ **@property=**] **'***property***'**  
 The property to change for the given publication. *property* is **sysname**, and can be one of the values listed in the table that follows.  
  
 [ **@value=**]  **'***value***'**  
 The new value for the specified property. *value* is **nvarchar(255)**, and can be one of the values listed in the table that follows.  
  
 This table describes the properties of the publication that can be changed, and describes restrictions on the values for those properties.

||**0**|The subscription is reinitialized without first uploading changes.|  
|**centralized_conflicts**|**true**|All conflict records are stored at the Publisher. If you change this property, existing Subscribers must be reinitialized.|  
||**false**|Conflict records are stored at the server that lost in the conflict resolution. If you change this property, existing Subscribers must be reinitialized.|  
|**compress_snapshot**|**true**|Snapshot in an alternative snapshot folder is compressed into the CAB format. The snapshot in the default snapshot folder cannot be compressed. Changing this property requires a new snapshot.|  
||**false**|By default, the snapshot is not compressed. Changing this property requires a new snapshot.|  
|**conflict_logging**|**publisher**|Conflict records are stored at the Publisher.|  
||**subscriber**|Conflict records are stored at the Subscriber that caused the conflict. Not supported for [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../analysis-services/instances/includes/ssew-md.md)] Subscribers*.*|  
||**both**|Conflict records are stored at both the Publisher and Subscriber.|  
|**conflict_retention**||An **int** that specifies the retention period, in days, for which conflicts are retained. Setting *conflict_retention* to **0** means no conflict cleanup is needed.|

|**post_snapshot_script**||Specifies a pointer to an **.sql** file location. The Distribution Agent or Merge Agent runs the post-snapshot script after all the other replicated object scripts and data have been applied during an initial synchronization. Changing this property requires a new snapshot.|

||**false**|Removes the publication information from Active Directory.|  
|**replicate_ddl**|**1**|Data Definition Language (DDL) statements that are executed at the Publisher are replicated.|  
||**0**|DDL statements are not replicated.|  
|**retention**||This is an **int** that represents the number of *retention_period_unit* units for which to save changes for the given publication. If the subscription is not synchronized within the retention period, and the pending changes it would have received have been removed by a clean-up operation at the Distributor, the subscription expires and must be reinitialized. The maximum allowable retention period is the number of days between December 31, 9999, and the current date.<br /><br /> Note: The retention period for merge publications has a 24 hour grace period to accommodate Subscribers in different time zones.|

|**snapshot_in_defaultfolder**|**true**|Snapshot files are stored in the default snapshot folder.|  
||**false**|Snapshot files are stored in the alternative location that is specified by *alt_snapshot_folder*. This combination specifies that the snapshot files are stored in both the default and alternative locations.|  
|**snapshot_ready**|**true**|Snapshot for the publication is available.|  
||**false**|Snapshot for the publication is not available.|  
|**status**|**active**|Publication is in an active state.|  
||**inactive**|Publication is in an inactive state.|  
|**sync_mode**|**native** or<br /><br /> **bcp native**|Native-mode bulk-copy program output of all tables is used for the initial snapshot.|  
||**character**<br /><br /> or **bcp character**|Character-mode bulk-copy program output of all tables is used for the initial snapshot, which is required for all non-[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Subscribers.|  
|**use_partition_groups**<br /><br /> Note: After using partition_groups,  if you to revert to using **setupbelongs**, and set **use_partition_groups=false** in **changemergearticle**, this might not be correctly reflected after a snapshot is taken. The triggers that are generated by snapshot are compliant with partition groups.<br /><br /> The workaround to this scenario is to set the status to Inactive, modify the **use_partition_groups**, and then set status to Active.|**true**|Publication uses precomputed partitions.|  
||**false**|Publication does not use precomputed partitions.|  
|**validate_subscriber_info**||Lists the functions that are being used to retrieve Subscriber information. Then, validates the dynamic filtering criteria that is being used for the Subscriber to verify that the information is partitioned consistently.|

|NULL (default)||Returns the list of supported values for *property*.|  
  
 [ **@force_invalidate_snapshot =** ] *force_invalidate_snapshot*  
 Acknowledges that the action taken by this stored procedure might invalidate an existing snapshot. *force_invalidate_snapshot* is a **bit**, with a default of **0**.  
  
 **0** specifies that changing the publication does not invalidate the snapshot. If the stored procedure detects that the change does require a new snapshot, an error occurs and no changes are made.  
  
 **1** specifies that changing the publication might invvalidate the snapshot. If there are existing subscriptions that would require a new snapshot, gives permission for the existing snapshot to be marked as obsolete and for a new snapshot to be generated.  
  
 See the Remarks section for the properties that, when changed, require a new snapshot to be generated.  
  
 [ **@force_reinit_subscription =** ] *force_reinit_subscription*  
 Acknowledges that the action taken by this stored procedure might require existing subscriptions to be reinitialized. *force_reinit_subscription* is a **bit** with a default of **0**.  
  
 **0** specifies that changing the publication does not require that subscriptions be reinitialized. If the stored procedure detects that the change would require existing subscriptions to be reinitialized, an error occurs and no changes are made.  
  
 **1** specifies that changing the publication causes existing subscriptions to be reinitialized, and gives permission for the subscription reinitialization to occur.  
  
 See the Remarks section for the properties that, when changed, require that all existing subscriptions be reinitialized.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_changemergepublication** is used in merge replication.  
  
 Changing the following properties requires that a new snapshot be generated. You you must specify a value of **1** for the *force_invalidate_snapshot* parameter.  
  
-   **alt_snapshot_folder**  
  
-   **compress_snapshot**  
  
-   **dynamic_filters**  
  
-   **ftp_address**  
  
-   **ftp_login**  
  
-   **ftp_password**  
  
-   **ftp_port**  
  
-   **ftp_subdirectory**  
  
-   **post_snapshot_script**  
  
-   **publication_compatibility_level** (to **80SP3** only)  
  
-   **pre_snapshot_script**  
  
-   **snapshot_in_defaultfolder**  
  
-   **sync_mode**  
  
-   **use_partition_groups**  
  
 Changing the following properties requires that existing subscriptions be reinitialized. You must specify a value of **1** for the *force_reinit_subscription* parameter.  
  
-   **dynamic_filters**  
  
-   **validate_subscriber_info**  
  
 To list publication objects to Active Directory by using the *publish_to_active_directory*, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] object must already be created in Active Directory.
