# Remove-PowerPivotSystemServiceInstance cmdlet
  Removes a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service instance from the farm.  
  
 **Applies To:** SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Remove-PowerPivotSystemServiceInstance [-Confirm <switch>] [-DeleteLocal <switch>] [-Identity <PowerPivotMidTierServiceInstancePipeBind>] [<CommonParameters>]  
```  
  
## Description  
 The Remove-PowerPivotSystemServiceInstance cmdlet removes instance information about [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service from the farm. It does not remove the program files. To permanently remove the program files, you must uninstall them.  
  
 If you remove [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service, be sure to also run Remove-PowerPivotEngineServiceInstance to remove the associated Analysis Services instance, followed by Remove-PowerPivotServiceApplication to delete any PowerPivotservice applications. The service applications will no longer run once theservices are removed.  
  
 To revert this change, you can run New-PowerPivotSystemServiceInstance -Provision:$true to re-enable instance information.

### -Identity \<PowerPivotMidTierServiceInstancePipeBind>  
 Specifies the GUID of the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service instance you want to remove. There is one service instance on each application server that has an installation of [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint.
