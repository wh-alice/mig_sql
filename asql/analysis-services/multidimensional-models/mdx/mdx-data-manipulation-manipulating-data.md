# MDX Data Manipulation - Manipulating Data
  Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) can be used to manipulate the data in a variety of ways. The following topics cover some of the more advanced concepts of data manipulation in the MDX language  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Using DRILLTHROUGH to Retrieve Source Data &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/Using%20DRILLTHROUGH%20to%20Retrieve%20Source%20Data%20\(MDX\).md)|Discusses the use of the MDX [DRILLTHROUGH](../Topic/DRILLTHROUGH%20Statement%20\(MDX\).md) statement to retrieve the rowsets of source data applicable to a cell in a multidimensional data source|  
|[Working with the RollupChildren Function &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/Working%20with%20the%20RollupChildren%20Function%20\(MDX\).md)|Discusses the impact of the MDX [RollupChildren](../../../mdx/rollupchildren-mdx.md)function on the analysis of multidimensional data.|  
|[Understanding Pass Order and Solve Order &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/Understanding%20Pass%20Order%20and%20Solve%20Order%20\(MDX\).md)|Details the concepts of solve order, and how this feature affects MDX expressions, statements, and scripts.|
