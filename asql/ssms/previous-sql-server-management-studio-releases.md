### ![download](../ssdt/media/download.png) [SQL Server Management Studio 16.4.1 (September 2016) release](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=828615)

**Version Information**  
  
*This release of SSMS uses the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell.*  
The release number: 16.4.1  
The build number for this release: 13.0.15900.1
  
**Known Issues with this Build**  

1. **Only a single Azure Active Directory account can log in for an SSMS instance using Active Directory Universal Authentication.**  
    This restriction is limited to Active Directory Universal Authentication - you can log in to different servers using Active Directory Password Authentication, Active Directory Integrated Authentication or SQL Server Authentication.
    
    As a workaround, you can use another instance of SSMS to login as another Azure Active Directory account. 
    
2. **Data-Tier Application Framework (DacFx) commands and the Schema Designer in SSMS do not support Active Directory Universal Authentication.**  
    Commands that use DacFx (e.g. import and export), the schema designer in SSMS do not currently support Active Directory Universal Authentication.
    
    As a workaround, you can use the other forms of authentication provided in SSMS - Active Directory Password Authentication, Active Directory Integrated Authentication or SQL Server Authentication.

3. **SSMS can only connect to SQL Server 2016 Integrated Services (SSIS 2016) instances.**  
    There is a known compatibility limitation with SQL Server Integration Services that prevents connecting to previous versions.
    
    As a workaround for this problem, you can connect to your SQL Server Integration Service instance by using the [SSMS release aligned with your SSIS instance.](../ssms/previous-sql-server-management-studio-releases.md) 
  
4. **SSMS won't save maintenance plans for SQL Server 2008 R2 and earlier SQL Server versions.**  
    This is a known limitation that we hope to address in the future. In the meantime, you can use the [SSMS 2014 release](../ssms/previous-sql-server-management-studio-releases.md) to save the maintenance plans.  
    
5. **Non-English SSMS installations may require the installation of an additional security package.**  
Non-English localized releases of SSMS [require the KB 2862966 security update package](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2862966) if installing on: Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
  
6. **SQL Server Configuration Manager will fail to launch if there is no SQL Server installed on the client machine**  
    If you do not have SQL Server installed on your client machine and launch SQL Server Configuration Manager, you will see the following error:   
     `Cannot connect to WMI provider. You do not have permission or the server is unreachable. Note that you can only manage SQL Server 2005 and later servers with SQL Server Configuration Manager. Invalid namespace \[0x8004100e]`,   
   
     * If you have added your SQL Server instances to 'Registered Servers' list in SSMS:  
        1. Navigate to 'Registered Servers' view in SSMS.  
        2. Right-click the SQL Server instance you would like to configure.  
        3. Select 'SQL Server Configuration Manager...' from the right-click menu.    
          
      * If you have not added a SQL Server instance to 'Registered Servers' list in SSMS:  
        1. Open a command promopt as Administrator.  
        2. Run the Mofcomp tool using the following command:  
    `mofcomp "%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Shared\sqlmgmproviderxpsp2up.mof"`  
        3. After you run the Mofcomp tool, run the following commands to restart the WMI service for the changes to take effect:  
        `net stop "Windows Management Instrumentation"`  
        `net start “Windows Management Instrumentation”`

### ![download](../ssdt/media/download.png) [SQL Server Management Studio July 2016 hotfix update release](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=822301)

July 13, 2016 | Version number: 13.0.15600.2

**Features**  
1. Support for Azure SQL Data Warehouse in SSMS.   
2. Significant updates to the SQL Server PowerShell module.   
3. Significantly improved connection times to Azure SQL databases.  
4. Improved support for SQL Server 2016 (1200 compatibility level) tabular databases in the Analysis Services process dialog, and many more.   

[More information and features available in the SSMS changelog.](../ssms/sql-server-management-studio---changelog--ssms-.md)

**Known Issues** 
1. **The installer for the SSMS July hotfix release shows up as SSMS August release.**
The setup page for the July Update hotfix says August due to an internal build setting. This package is in fact a hotfix for the SSMS July release. 
2. **SSMS cannot connect to SQL Server instances after installing the 'July 2016 hotfix' release.**
We are aware of an issue regarding the latest SSMS update where attempting to connect to a server results in the following error message: 
   ```
    "Method not found: 'Void Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.SqlConnectionInfo.set_ApplicationIntent(System.String)'. (ConnectionDlg)"
    ```
  
    The fix for this problem will be available in the next SSMS release. As a workaround for this issue, you can uninstall and reinstall SSMS. For more details, [visit this Microsoft Connect thread on the issue](https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/2925257/not-able-to-connect-to-sql-server-instances-after-installing-ssms-2016-july-update).
    
3. **SSMS crashes when trying to select an Azure storage account.**
The SSMS July release and July hotfix release crash if you try to select an Azure storage account and do not have a 'classic' storage account.
The fix for this issue will be available in an upcoming SSMS release. As a workaround for this problem, you can backup/restore your databases to an Azure storage account by creating a classic storage account, or by [using T-SQL to backup or restore](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj720552(v=sql.120).aspx).

4. **SSMS will only display 'classic' Azure storage accounts in the Backup/Restore wizards.**
The SSMS July release and July hotfix release display only 'classic' Azure storage accounts for new credential creation if you're trying to backup or restore using the backup or restore wizards.
The fix for this issue will be available in an upcoming SSMS release. As a workaround for this problem, you can backup/restore your databases to the available Azure 'classic' storage account, or backup to the 'ARM-type' storage accounts [using T-SQL to backup or restore](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj720552(v=sql.120).aspx). 

5. **Non-English SSMS installations may require the installation of an additional security package.**
Non-English localized releases of SSMS require the [KB 2862966 security update package](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2862966) if installing on: Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
6. **SSMS can only connect to SQL Server 2016 Integrated Services (SSIS 2016) instances.** There is a known compatibility limitation with SQL Server Integration Services that prevents connecting to previous versions.
As a workaround for this problem, you can connect to your SQL Server Integration Service instance by using the SSMS release aligned with your SSIS instance.
7. **SSMS won't save maintenance plans for SQL Server 2008 R2 and earlier SQL Server versions.** We are working on a fix for this issue. In the meantime, you can use the SSMS 2014 release below to save the maintenance plans.
8. **SQL Server Configuration Manager will fail to launch if there is no SQL Server installed on the client machine.** If you do not have SQL Server installed on your client machine and launch SQL Server Configuration Manager, you will receive the 'Cannot connect to WMI provider' error. As a workaround:
    * Open a command prompt as Administrator.
    * Run the Mofcomp tool using the following command:  
      mofcomp "%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Shared\sqlmgmproviderxpsp2up.mof"
    * After you run the Mofcomp tool, run the following commands to restart the WMI service for the changes to take effect:  
       net stop "Windows Management Instrumentation"  
       net start "Windows Management Instrumentation"

**Fixes**  
1. Bug fix in SSMS query designer to allow adding tables to the designer if a user doesn't have SELECT permissions on them.
2. Bug fix to add IntelliSense support for 'TRY_CAST()', and 'TRY_CONVERT()' functions [(Microsoft Connect item #2453461)](https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/2453461/sql-server-2012-issue-with-try-cast).
3. Bug fix in the SSMS editor window to allow drag-and-drop open of Sql files [(Microsoft Connect item #2690658)](https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/2690658/cannot-drag-sql-files-into-management-studios).
4. Bug fix in Analysis Services to correctly show the Data Feed provider for multi-dimensional Analysis Services models.
5. Bug fix in SSMS to prevent crash when trying to edit a join link in the SSMS table designer [(Microsoft Connect item #2721052)](https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/2721052/ssms-view-design-mode-right-click-on-join-crashes-ssms).
