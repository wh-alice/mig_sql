# Lesson 5: Deploy and Use the Model (Data Science End-to-End Walkthrough)
In this lesson, you will use your R models in a production environment, by wrapping the persisted model in a stored procedure. You can then  invoke the stored procedure from R or any application programming language that supports [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] (such as C#, Java, Python, etc), to use the model to make predictions on new observations.  
  
There are two different ways that you can call a  model for scoring:  
  
-   **Batch scoring mode** lets you create multiple predictions based on input from a SELECT query.  
  
-   **Individual scoring mode** lets you create predictions one at a time, by passing a set of feature values for an individual case to the stored procedure, which returns a single prediction or other value as the result.  
  
You'll learn how to create predictions using both the individual scoring and batch scoring methods.  
  
## Batch Scoring  
For convenience, you can use a stored procedure that was created when you initially ran the PowerShell script in Lesson 1. This stored procedure does the following:  
  
-   Gets a set of input data as a SQL query    
-   Calls the trained logistic regression model that you saved in the previous lesson    
-   Predicts the probability that the driver will get a tip  
  
### Use the stored procedure PredictTipBatchMode

1. Take a minute to look over the script that defines the stored procedure, *PredictTipBatchMode*. It illustrates several aspects of how a model can be operationalized using [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../../a9notintoc/includes/rsql-productname-md.md)].  
  
    ```tsql  
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[PredictTipBatchMode]   
    @input nvarchar(max)  
    AS  
    BEGIN  
  
      DECLARE @lmodel2 varbinary(max) = (SELECT TOP 1 model  FROM nyc_taxi_models);  
      EXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R',  
         @script = N'  
           mod <- unserialize(as.raw(model));  
           print(summary(mod))  
           OutputDataSet<-rxPredict(modelObject = mod, 
		       data = InputDataSet, 
			   outData = NULL, 
			   predVarNames = "Score", type = "response", 
			   writeModelVars = FALSE, overwrite = TRUE);  
           str(OutputDataSet)  
           print(OutputDataSet)',  
      @input_data_1 = @input,  
      @params = N'@model varbinary(max)',  
      @model = @lmodel2  
      WITH RESULT SETS ((Score float));  
    END    
    ```  

    + Note the SELECT statement that calls the stored model. You can store any trained model in a SQL table, by using a column of type **varbinary(max)**. In this code, the model is retrieved from the table, stored in the SQL variable _@lmodel2_, and passed as the parameter *mod* to the system stored procedure [sp_execute_external_script &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md).
    + The input data used for scoring is passed as a string to the stored procedure.  
  
        To define input data for this particular model, create a query that returns valid data. As data is retrieved from the database, it is stored in a data frame called *InputDataSet*. All the rows in this data frame are used for batch scoring.
        + *InputDataSet* is the default name for input data to the [sp_execute_external_script &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md) procedure; you can define another variable name if needed.
        + To generate the scores, the stored procedure calls the *rxPredict* function from the **RevoScaleR** library.
    + The return value for the stored procedure, *Score*, is a predicted probability that the driver will be given a tip.  
  
2.  Optionally, you could easily apply some kind of filter to the returned values to categorize the return values into "yes - tip " or "no tip" groups.  For example, a probability of less than 0.5 would mean no tip is likely.  
  
3.  Call the stored procedure in batch mode:  
  
    ```R  
    input = "N' 
	  SELECT TOP 10 
	      a.passenger_count AS passenger_count,   
          a.trip_time_in_secs AS trip_time_in_secs,  
          a.trip_distance AS trip_distance,  
          a.dropoff_datetime AS dropoff_datetime,    
          dbo.fnCalculateDistance(
			pickup_latitude, 
			pickup_longitude, 
			dropoff_latitude,
			dropoff_longitude) AS direct_distance   
      FROM  
	  
      (SELECT medallion, hack_license, pickup_datetime,   
      passenger_count,trip_time_in_secs,trip_distance,    
      dropoff_datetime, pickup_latitude, pickup_longitude,   
      dropoff_latitude, dropoff_longitude from nyctaxi_sample)a  
	  
      LEFT OUTER JOIN  
 
      ( SELECT medallion, hack_license, pickup_datetime 
	    FROM nyctaxi_sample  tablesample (1 percent) repeatable (98052)  )b  

      ON a.medallion=b.medallion 
	    AND a.hack_license=b.hack_license 
	    AND a.pickup_datetime=b.pickup_datetime  

      WHERE b.medallion is null  
    '"  
    q<-paste("EXEC PredictTipBatchMode @inquery = ", input, sep="")  
    sqlQuery (conn, q)  
  
    ```  
  
## Single Row Scoring  

Instead of using a query to pass the input values to the saved R model, you might want to provide the features as arguments to the stored procedure.  

### Use the stored procedure PredictTipSingleMode
1.  Take a minute to review the following code is for the stored procedure, *PredictTipSingleMode*, which should already be created in your database.  
  
    ```tsql  
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[PredictTipSingleMode] @passenger_count int = 0,  
    @trip_distance float = 0,  
    @trip_time_in_secs int = 0,  
    @pickup_latitude float = 0,  
    @pickup_longitude float = 0,  
    @dropoff_latitude float = 0,  
    @dropoff_longitude float = 0  
    AS  
    BEGIN  
      DECLARE @inquery nvarchar(max) = N'  
        SELECT * FROM [dbo].[fnEngineerFeatures](@passenger_count, 
			@trip_distance,  
            @trip_time_in_secs,  
            @pickup_latitude,  
            @pickup_longitude,  
            @dropoff_latitude,  
            @dropoff_longitude)  
        '  
      DECLARE @lmodel2 varbinary(max) = (SELECT TOP 1 model FROM nyc_taxi_models);  

      EXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R',  @script = N'  
            mod <- unserialize(as.raw(model));  
            print(summary(mod))  
            OutputDataSet<-rxPredict(
			         modelObject = mod, 
					 data = InputDataSet, 
					 outData = NULL,   
					 predVarNames = "Score", 
					 type = "response", 
					 writeModelVars = FALSE, 
					 overwrite = TRUE);  
            str(OutputDataSet)  
            print(OutputDataSet)  
            ',  
      @input_data_1 = @inquery,  
      @params = N'@model varbinary(max),
	            @passenger_count int,
				@trip_distance float,
				@trip_time_in_secs int ,  
				@pickup_latitude float ,
				@pickup_longitude float ,
				@dropoff_latitude float ,
				@dropoff_longitude float',  
				@model = @lmodel2,  
				@passenger_count =@passenger_count ,  
				@trip_distance=@trip_distance,  
				@trip_time_in_secs=@trip_time_in_secs,    
				@pickup_latitude=@pickup_latitude,  
				@pickup_longitude=@pickup_longitude,  
				@dropoff_latitude=@dropoff_latitude,  
				@dropoff_longitude=@dropoff_longitude  
      WITH RESULT SETS ((Score float));  
    END    
    ```  
  
    This stored procedure takes feature values as input, such as passenger count and trip distance, scores these features using the stored R model, and outputs a score.  
  
### Call the stored procedure and pass parameters

1. In SQL Server Management Studio, you can use the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../a9notintoc/includes/tsql-md.md)] **EXEC** to call the stored procedure, and pass it the required inputs. .  
    ```tsql  
    EXEC [dbo].[PredictTipSingleMode] 1, 2.5, 631, 40.763958,-73.973373, 40.782139,-73.977303   
    ```  
  
    The values passed in here are, respectively, for the variables _passenger_count_, _trip_distance_, _trip_time_in_secs_, _pickup_latitude_, _pickup_longitude_, _dropoff_latitude_, and _dropoff_longitude_.  
  
2.  To run this same call from R code, you simply define an R variable that contains the entire stored procedure call. 
  
    ```R  
    q = "EXEC PredictTipSingleMode 1, 2.5, 631, 40.763958,-73.973373, 40.782139,-73.977303 "  
    ```  
  
    The values passed in here are, respectively, for the variables _passenger_count_, _trip_distance_, _trip_time_in_secs_, _pickup_latitude_, _pickup_longitude_, _dropoff_latitude_, and _dropoff_longitude_.  
  
### Generate scores

1. Call the *sqlQuery* function of the **RODBC** package, and pass the connection string and the string variable containing the the stored procedure call.  
  
    ```R  
    # predict with stored procedure in single mode  
    sqlQuery (conn, q)   
    ```  
  
    For more information about **RODBC**, see [http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/RODBC/docs/sqlQuery](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/RODBC/docs/sqlQuery).  
  
## Conclusion  
Now that you have learned how to work with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data and persist trained R models to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], it should be relatively easy for you to create some additional models based on this data set. For example, you might try creating models like these:  
  
-   A regression model that predicts the tip amount    
-   A multiclass classification model that predicts whether the tip will be big, medium, or small.
