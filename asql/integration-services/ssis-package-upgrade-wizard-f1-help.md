## Select Package Management Options page
  Use the **Select Package Management Options** page to specify options for upgrading packages.  
  
 **To run the SSIS Package Upgrade Wizard**  
  
-   [Upgrade Integration Services Packages Using the SSIS Package Upgrade Wizard](../integration-services/install/windows/upgrade-integration-services-packages-using-the-ssis-package-upgrade-wizard.md)  
  
### Options  
 **Update connection strings to use new provider names**  
 Update the connection strings to use the names for the following providers for the current release of [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
-   OLE DB Provider for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Package Upgrade Wizard updates only connection strings that are stored in connection managers. The wizard does not update connection strings that are constructed dynamically by using the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] expression language, or by using code in a Script task.  
  
 **Validate upgrade packages**  
 Validate the upgrade packages and save only those upgrade packages that pass validation.  
  
 If you do not select this option, the wizard will not validate upgrade packages. Therefore, the wizard will save all upgrade packages, regardless of whether the packages are valid or not. The wizard saves upgrade packages to the destination that is specified on the **SelectDestination Location** page of the wizard.  
  
 Validation adds time to the upgrade process. We recommend that you do not select this option for large packages that are likely to be upgraded successfully.  
  
 **Create new package IDs**  
 Create new package IDs for the upgrade packages.  
  
 **Continue upgrade process when a package upgrade fails**  
 Specify that when a package cannot be upgraded, the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Package Upgrade Wizard continues to upgrade the remaining packages.  
  
 **Package name conflicts**  
 Specify how the wizard should handle packages that have the same name. This option has the values listed in the following table.  
  
 **Overwrite existing package files**  
 Replaces the existing package with the upgrade package of the same name.  
  
 **Add numeric suffixes to upgrade package names**  
 Adds a numeric suffix to the name of the upgrade package.  
  
 **Do not upgrade packages**  
 Stops the packages from being upgraded and displays an error when you complete the wizard.  
  
 These options are not available when you select the **Save to source location** option on the **Select Destination Location** page of the wizard.  
  
 **Ignore Configurations**  
 Does not load package configurations during the package upgrade. Selecting this option reduces the time required to upgrade the package.  
  
 **Backup original packages**  
 Have the wizard back up the original packages to an **SSISBackupFolder** folder. The wizard creates the **SSISBackupFolder** folder as a subfolder to the folder that contains the original packages and the upgraded packages.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is available only when you specify that the original packages and the upgraded packages are stored in the file system and in the same folder.  

## Select Packages page
  Use the **Select Packages** page to select the packages to upgrade. This page lists the packages that are stored in the location that was specified on the **Select Source Location** page of the wizard.  
  
### Options  
 **Existing package name**  
 Select one or more packages to upgrade.  
  
 **Upgrade package name**  
 Provide the destination package name, or use the default name that the wizard provides.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can also change the destination package name after upgrading the package. In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], open the upgraded package and change the package name.  
  
 **Password**  
 Specify the password that is used to decrypt the selected upgrade packages.  
  
 **Apply to selection**  
 Apply the specified password to decrypt the selected upgrade packages.  
 
## Complete the Wizard page
  Use the **Complete the Wizard** page to review and confirm the package upgrade options that you have selected. This is the last wizard page from which you can go back and change options for this session of the wizard.  
  
### Options  
 **Summary of options**  
 Review the upgrade options that you have selected in the wizard. To change any options, click **Back** to return to previous wizard pages.
 
## Upgrading the Packages page
  Use the **Upgrading the Packages** page to view the progress of package upgrade and to interrupt the upgrade process. The [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../a9retired/includes/ssis-md.md)] Package Upgrade Wizard upgrades the selected packages one by one.  
  
### Options  
 **Message pane**  
 Displays progress messages and summary information during the upgrade process.  
  
 **Action**  
 View the actions in the upgrade.  
  
 **Status**  
 View the result of each action.  
  
 **Message**  
 View the error messages that each action generates.  
  
 **Stop**
