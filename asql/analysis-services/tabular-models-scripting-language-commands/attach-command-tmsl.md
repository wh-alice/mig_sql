 The [\[MS-SSAS-T\]: QL Server Analysis Services Tabular (SQL Server Technical Protocol)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=784855) document includes section 3.1.5.2.2 that describes the structure of JSON tabular metadata commands and objects. Currently, that document covers commands and capabilities not yet implemented in TMSL script. Refer to the topic [Tabular Model Scripting Language &#40;TMSL&#41; Reference](../../analysis-services/tabular-model-scripting-language-tmsl-reference.md) for clarification on what is supported  
  
 For instructions on how to leverage TMSL script in practical solutions, see [Script Administrative Tasks in Analysis Services](../../analysis-services/instances/script-administrative-tasks-in-analysis-services.md).
