# Objects (ASSL)
  This reference section contains syntax and usage information for each element that acts as an object in the Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL) schema.  
  
 Although the ASSL schema contains only XML elements, from a developer's point of view, the elements described in this section correspond to objects, such as **Database**, **Cube**, and **Dimension** objects, in the hierarchy of objects contained by an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 Objects are never leaf-level elements in the ASSL schema, but have child elements and elements that correspond to object properties.  
  
 In a few cases, a leaf-level element in the schema that may appear to be a property is classified as an object because the element's type is an object type. For example, the **Source** of a **Dimension** object is of type **DimensionBinding**.
