# Integration Services (SSIS) in a Cluster
  Clustering [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] is not recommended because the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service is not a clustered or cluster-aware service, and does not support failover from one cluster node to another. Therefore, in a clustered environment, [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] should be installed and started as a stand-alone service on each node in the cluster.  
  
 Although the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service is not a clustered service, you can manually configure the service to operate as a cluster resource after you install [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] separately on each node of the cluster.  
  
 However, if high availability is your goal in establishing a clustered hardware environment, you can achieve this goal without configuring the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service as a cluster resource.  To manage your packages on any node in the cluster from any other node in the cluster, modify the configuration file for the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service on each node in the cluster. You modify each of these configuration files to point to all available instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on which packages are stored. This solution provides the high availability that most customers need, without the potential problems encountered when the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service is configured as a cluster resource. For more information about how to change the configuration file, see [Configuring the Integration Services Service &#40;SSIS Service&#41;](../../integration-services/service/configuring-the-integration-services-service-ssis-service.md)  
  
 Understanding the role of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service is critical to making an informed decision about how to configure the service in a clustered environment. For more information, see [Integration Services Service &#40;SSIS Service&#41;](../../integration-services/service/integration-services-service-ssis-service.md).  
  
## Understanding the Disadvantages of Configuring Integration Services as a Cluster Resource  
 Some of the potential disadvantages of configuring the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service as a cluster resource include the following:  
  
-   **When a failover occurs, running packages do not restart.**
    
    You can recover from package failures by restarting packages from checkpoints. You can restart from checkpoints without configuring the service as a cluster resource. For more information, see [Restart Packages by Using Checkpoints](../../integration-services/packages/restart-packages-by-using-checkpoints.md).  
  
-   When you configure the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service in a different resource group from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you cannot use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] from client computers to manage packages that are stored in the msdb database. The [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service cannot delegate credentials in this double-hop scenario.  
  
-   When you have multiple [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resource groups that include the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service in a cluster, a failover could lead to unexpected results. Consider the following scenario. Group1, which includes the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service and the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service, is running on Node A. Group2, which also includes the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service and the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service, is running on Node B. Group 2 fails over to Node A. The attempt to start another instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service on Node A fails because the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service is a single-instance service. Whether the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service that is trying to fail over to Node A also fails depends on the configuration of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service in Group 2. If the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service was configured to affect the other services in the resource group, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service that is failing over will fail because the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service failed. If the service was configured not to affect the other services in the resource group, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service will be able to fail over to Node A.Unless the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service in Group 2 was configured not to affect the other services in the resource group, the failure of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service that is failing over could cause the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service that is failing over to fail also.
