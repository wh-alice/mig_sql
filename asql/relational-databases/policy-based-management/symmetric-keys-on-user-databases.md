# Symmetric Keys on User Databases
  This rule checks whether keys that have a length of less than 128 bytes do not use the RC2 or RC4 encryption algorithm.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 Use AES 128 bit or larger to create symmetric keys for data encryption. If AES is not supported by your operating system, use 3DES.
