# Spatial Types - geography
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  The geography spatial data type, **geography**, is implemented as a .NET common language runtime (CLR) data type in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This type represents data in a round-earth coordinate system. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] **geography** data type stores ellipsoidal (round-earth) data, such as GPS latitude and longitude coordinates.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports a set of methods for the **geography** spatial data type. This includes methods on **geography** that are defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard and a set of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] extensions to that standard.  
 
 The error tolerance for the **geography** methods can be as large as 1.0e-7 * extents. The extents refer to the approximate maximal distance between points of the **geography**object.
  

## Registering the geography Type  
 The **geography** type is predefined and available in each database. You can create table columns of type **geography** and operate on **geography** data in the same manner as you would use other system-supplied types. Can be used in persisted and non-persisted computed columns.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Showing how to add and query geography data  
 The following examples show how to add and query geography data. The first example creates a table with an identity column and a `geography` column, `GeogCol1`. A third column renders the `geography` column into its Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Well-Known Text (WKT) representation, and uses the `STAsText()` method. Two rows are then inserted: one row contains a `LineString` instance of `geography`, and one row contains a `Polygon` instance.  
  
```  
IF OBJECT_ID ( 'dbo.SpatialTable', 'U' ) IS NOT NULL   
    DROP TABLE dbo.SpatialTable;  
GO  
  
CREATE TABLE SpatialTable   
    ( id int IDENTITY (1,1),  
    GeogCol1 geography,   
    GeogCol2 AS GeogCol1.STAsText() );  
GO  
  
INSERT INTO SpatialTable (GeogCol1)  
VALUES (geography::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656 )', 4326));  
  
INSERT INTO SpatialTable (GeogCol1)  
VALUES (geography::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((-122.358 47.653 , -122.348 47.649, -122.348 47.658, -122.358 47.658, -122.358 47.653))', 4326));  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Returning the intersection of two geography instances  
 The following example uses the `STIntersection()` method to return the points where the two previously inserted `geography` instances intersect.  
  
```  
DECLARE @geog1 geography;  
DECLARE @geog2 geography;  
DECLARE @result geography;  
  
SELECT @geog1 = GeogCol1 FROM SpatialTable WHERE id = 1;  
SELECT @geog2 = GeogCol1 FROM SpatialTable WHERE id = 2;  
SELECT @result = @geog1.STIntersection(@geog2);  
SELECT @result.STAsText();  
```  
  
### C. Using geography in a computed column  
 The following example creates a table with a persisted computed column using a **geography** type.  
  
```  
IF OBJECT_ID ( 'dbo.SpatialTable', 'U' ) IS NOT NULL   
    DROP TABLE dbo.SpatialTable;  
GO  
  
CREATE TABLE SpatialTable  
(  
    locationId int IDENTITY(1,1),  
    location geography,  
    deliveryArea as location.STBuffer(10) persisted  
)  
```
