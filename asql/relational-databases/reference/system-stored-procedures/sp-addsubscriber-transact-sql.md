# sp_addsubscriber (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Adds a new Subscriber to a Publisher, enabling it to receive publications. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database for snapshot and transactional publications; and for merge publications using a remote Distributor, this stored procedure is executed at the Distributor.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This stored procedure has been deprecated. You are no longer required to explicitly register a Subscriber at the Publisher.

## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_addsubscriber** is used in snapshot replication, transactional replication, and merge replication.  
  
 **sp_addsubscriber** is not required when the Subscriber will only have anonymous subscriptions to merge publications.  
  
 **sp_addsubscriber** writes to the [MSsubscriber_info](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-tables/mssubscriber-info-transact-sql.md) table in the **distribution** database.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can execute **sp_addsubscriber**.
