## Explanation  
 To create a publication, you must be a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role on the Publisher or a member of the **db_owner** fixed database role in the publication database. If you are a member of the **db_owner** role, this error is raised if:  
  
-   You run scripts from [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssversion2000-md.md)]. The security model changed in [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)], and these scripts must be updated.  
  
-   The stored procedure **sp_addpublication** is executed before executing [sp_addlogreader_agent &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addlogreader-agent-transact-sql.md). This applies to all transactional publications.  
  
-   The stored procedure **sp_addpublication** is executed before executing [sp_addqreader_agent &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/reference/system-stored-procedures/sp-addqreader-agent-transact-sql.md). This applies to transactional publications that are enabled for queued updating subscriptions (a value of TRUE for the **@allow_queued_tran** parameter of **sp_addpublication**).  
  
 The stored procedures **sp_addlogreader_agent** and **sp_addqreader_agent** each create an agent job and allow you to specify the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../a9notintoc/includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows account under which the agent runs. For users in the **sysadmin** role, agent jobs are created implicitly if **sp_addlogreader_agent** and **sp_addqreader_agent** are not executed; agents run under the context of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service account at the Distributor. Although **sp_addlogreader_agent** and **sp_addqreader_agent** are not required for users in the **sysadmin** role, it is a security best practice to specify a separate account for the agents. For more information, see [Replication Agent Security Model](../../relational-databases/replication/security/replication-agent-security-model.md).  
  
## User Action  
 Ensure you execute procedures in the correct order. For more information, see [Create a Publication](../../relational-databases/replication/publish/create-a-publication.md). If you have replication scripts from previous versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], update these scripts to include the stored procedures and parameters required by [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] and later versions. For more information, see [Upgrade Replication Scripts &#40;Replication Transact-SQL Programming&#41;](../../relational-databases/replication/administration/upgrade-replication-scripts-replication-transact-sql-programming.md).
