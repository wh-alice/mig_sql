# Executing SQL Queries (SQLXMLOLEDB Provider)
  This example illustrates the use of the following SQLXMLOLEDB Provider-specific properties:  
  
-   ClientSideXML  
  
-   xml root  
  
 In this client-side ADO sample application, a simple SQL query is executed on the client. Because the ClientSideXML property is set to True, the SELECT statement without the FOR XML clause is sent to the server. The server executes the query and returns a rowset to the client. The client then applies the FOR XML transformation to the rowset and produces an XML document.  
  
 The xml root property provides the single top-level root element for the XML document that is generated.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In the code, you must provide the name of the instance of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in the connection string. Also, this example specifies the use of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client (SQLNCLI11) for the data provider, which requires additional network client software to be installed. For more information, see [System Requirements for SQL Server Native Client](../../../relational-databases/native-client/system-requirements-for-sql-server-native-client.md).
