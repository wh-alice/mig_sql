# Step 5: Train and Save a Model using T-SQL
In this step, you'll learn how to train a machine learning model by using R. The R  packages are already installed with [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-productname-md.md)] so you can call the algorithm from a stored procedure. You'll train the model using the data features you just created, and then save the trained model in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table.  
  
## Building an R Model using Stored Procedures  
All calls to the R runtime that is installed with [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-productname-md.md)] are done by using the system stored procedure, [sp_execute_external_script](../../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md). However, if you need to retrain a model, it is probably easier to encapsulate the call to  sp_execute_exernal_script in another stored procedure.  
  
In this section, you'll create a stored procedure that can be used to build a model using the data you just prepared. This stored procedure defines the input data and uses an R package to create a logistic regression model.  
  
#### To create the stored procedure  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], open a new Query window and run the following statement to create the stored procedure _TrainTipPredictionModel_.  
  
    Note that, because the stored procedure already includes a definition of the input data, you don't need to provide an input query.  
  
    ```  
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[TrainTipPredictionModel]  
  
    AS  
    BEGIN  
      DECLARE @inquery nvarchar(max) = N'  
        select tipped, fare_amount, passenger_count,trip_time_in_secs,trip_distance,   
        pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime,   
        dbo.fnCalculateDistance(pickup_latitude, pickup_longitude,  dropoff_latitude, dropoff_longitude) as direct_distance  
        from nyctaxi_sample  
        tablesample (70 percent) repeatable (98052)  
    '  
      -- Insert the trained model into a database table  
      INSERT INTO nyc_taxi_models  
      EXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R',  
                                      @script = N'  
  
    ## Create model  
    logitObj <- rxLogit(tipped ~ passenger_count + trip_distance + trip_time_in_secs + direct_distance, data = InputDataSet)  
    summary(logitObj)  
  
    ## Serialize model and put it in data frame  
    trained_model <- data.frame(model=as.raw(serialize(logitObj, NULL)));  
    ',  
                                      @input_data_1 = @inquery,  
                                      @output_data_1_name = N'trained_model'  
      ;  
  
    END  
    GO  
  
    ```  
  
    This stored procedure performs these activities as part of model training:  
  
    -   To ensure that some data is left over to test the model, 70% of the data are randomly selected from the taxi data table.  
  
    -   The SELECT query uses the custom scalar function _fnCalculateDistance_ to calculate the direct distance between the pick-up and drop-off locations.  the results of the query are stored in the default R input variable, `InputDataset`.  
  
    -   the R script calls the `rxLogit` function, which is one of the enhanced R functions included with [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-productname-md.md)], to create the logistic regression model.  
  
        The binary variable _tipped_ is used as the *label* or outcome column,  and the model is fit using these feature columns:  _passenger_count_, _trip_distance_, _trip_time_in_secs_, and _direct_distance_.  
  
    -   The trained model, saved in the R variable `logitObj`, is serialized and put in a data frame for output to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. That output is inserted into the database table _nyc_taxi_models_, so that you can use it for future predictions.  
  
2.  Run the statement to create the stored procedure.  
  
#### To create the R model using the stored procedure  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], run this statement.  
  
    ```  
    EXEC TrainTipPredictionModel  
    ```  
  
    Processing of the data and fitting the model  might take a while. Messages that would be piped to R's **stdout** stream are displayed in the **Messages** window of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. For example:  
  
  
*STDOUT message(s) from external script: Rows Read: 1193025, Total Rows Processed: 1193025, Total Chunk Time: 0.093 seconds*       
  
Successive chunks of data are read and processed. You might also see messages specific to the individual function, `rxLogit`, indicating the variable and test metrics.  
  
2.  Open the table *nyc_taxi_models*. You can see that one new row has been added, which contains the serialized model in the column _model_.  
  
  
  
*model*  
*0x580A00000002000302020....*  
  
In the next step you'll use the trained model to create predictions.
