# Create and Publish a Business Rule (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], create a business rule to ensure the accuracy of your master data. After you create a rule, you must publish it before you can apply it to data.

-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.
