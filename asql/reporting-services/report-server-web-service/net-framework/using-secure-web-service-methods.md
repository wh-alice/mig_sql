# Using Secure Web Service Methods
  Certain Report Server Web service methods may require a secure connection when you invoke them. The methods that require a secure connection are determined by the **SecureConnectionLevel** setting in the RSReportServer.config file. The value of the setting is an integer value with a valid range of 0 and higher. The following table describes these values.  
  
|Level|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**0**|Not secure. Calls made to the Reporting Services SOAP API do not require a secure connection.|  
|Greater than **0**|Secure. All calls made to the Reporting Services SOAP API require a secure connection.|  
  
 You can use the <xref:ReportExecution2005.ReportExecutionService.ListSecureMethods%2A> method of the Web service to return a list of Web service methods that require a secure connection according to the current configuration of the report server. In an SSL scenario, you should evaluate the list of methods that are returned by <xref:ReportExecution2005.ReportExecutionService.ListSecureMethods%2A> and change the scheme name of the Web service URI to "https" or "http" depending on the method being called.
