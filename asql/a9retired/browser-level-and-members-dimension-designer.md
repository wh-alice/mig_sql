# Browser - Level and Members (Dimension Designer)
  Use this pane to browse the members of the currently selected hierarchy and language. To select a hierarchy or language to browse, use the **Hierarchy** and **Language** options on the **Toolbar** pane. For more information about the Toolbar pane, see [Toolbar &#40;Browser Tab, Dimension Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../a9retired/browser-toolbar-dimension-designer.md).  
  
## Writeback Mode  
 The functionality of this pane changes if writeback mode is enabled. The selected dimension must be write-enabled (in other words, the **WriteEnabled** property of the dimension must be set to true) and the dimension must be deployed to an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance in order to enable writeback mode.  
  
 To enable writeback mode, you can either select **Writeback** from the **Toolbar** pane, or right-click the **Level and Members** pane and select **Writeback** from the context menu.  
  
 If writeback mode is enabled, you can perform the following additional actions in the **Level and Members** pane:  
  
|To do|Perform|  
|-----------|-------------|  
|Create sibling and child members within the selected hierarchy.|Right-click the selected member and select either **Create Sibling**, to create a sibling member, or **Create Child**, to create a child member, from the context menu.|  
|Move a selected member up or down the hierarchy.|Either drag the selected member to the appropriate parent or child member, or click **Increase Indent** or **Decrease Indent** on the **Toolbar** pane to move the selected member up or down the levels of the hierarchy.|  
|Rename a selected member.|Either right-click the selected member and select **Rename**, or click an already-selected member.|  
|Edit member property values|Double-click the value in the selected member property for the selected member to edit the value.|
