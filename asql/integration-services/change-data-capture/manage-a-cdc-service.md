# Manage a CDC Service
  You can use the CDC Designer Console to view the services you created with the CDC Service Configuration Console and manage all of the instances in the Oracle CDC Service.  
  
 Click the name of the service in the left pane to display information about the service and to manage it.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You must first create a service using the CDC Service Configuration Console to add services to this list. For information on how to create a service, see the online help provided with the CDC Service Configuration Console.  
  
## What you can do when you display the CDC service information  
 You can do the following when you display information about a service:  
  
 **Create a new CDC instance for the selected service**  
  
 Click **New Oracle CDC Instance** in the right pane to create a new instance for that service. The New Instance wizard opens to create the instance. For more information about the New Instance wizard, see [Use the New Instance Wizard](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/use-the-new-instance-wizard.md).  
  
 **Start all CDC instances in the service**  
  
 Click **Start All Instances** in the right pane to begin capturing data from all the defined instances in the service.  
  
 **Stop all CDC instances in the service**  
  
 Click **Stop All Instances** to stop the change data capture for all instances in the service.
