# Prediction Query Builder (Data Mining)
  Use the **Mining Model Prediction** view to create predictions based on mining models that a mining structure contains.  
  
 For a walkthrough of how to use the Prediction Query Builder to create data mining queries, we recommend that you review the following tutorials and topics:  
  
-   [Basic Data Mining Tutorial](../a9notintoc/basic-data-mining-tutorial.md)  
  
-   [Creating and Querying Data Mining Models with DMX: Tutorials &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../a9notintoc/145b81a7-c0c3-4ca3-bb32-0b482423b9a0.md)  
  
-   [Data Mining Queries](../analysis-services/data-mining/data-mining-queries.md)  
  
-   [Data Mining Query Tasks and How-tos](../analysis-services/data-mining/data-mining-query-tasks-and-how-tos.md)  
  
 The **Mining Model Prediction** view has the following tools and dialog boxes:  
  
-   [Design Pane &#40;Mining Model Prediction View&#41;](../a9retired/design-pane-mining-model-prediction-view.md)  
  
-   [Query Pane &#40;Mining Model Prediction View&#41;](../a9retired/query-pane-mining-model-prediction-view.md)  
  
-   [Result Pane &#40;Mining Model Prediction View&#41;](../a9retired/result-pane-mining-model-prediction-view.md)  
  
-   [Select Mining Model Dialog Box &#40;Mining Model Prediction View&#41;](../a9retired/select-mining-model-dialog-box-mining-model-prediction-view.md)
