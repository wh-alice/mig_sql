# Create and Test a Classifier User-Defined Function
  This topic shows how to create and test a classifier user-defined function (UDF). The steps involve executing [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] statements in the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Query Editor.  
  
 The example shown in the following procedure illustrates the possibilities for creating a fairly complex classifier user-defined function.  
  
 In our example:  
  
-   A resource pool (pProductionProcessing) and workload group (gProductionProcessing) are created for production processing during a specified time range.  
  
-   A resource pool (pOffHoursProcessing) and workload group (gOffHoursProcessing) are created for handling connections that do not meet the requirements for production processing.  
  
-   A table (TblClassificationTimeTable) is created in master to hold start and end times that can be evaluated against a login time. This must be created in master because Resource Governor uses schema binding for classifier functions.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  As a best practice, you should not store large, frequently updated tables in master.  
  
 The classifier function extends the login time. An overly complex function can cause logins to time out or slow down fast connections.  
  
### To create the classifier user-defined function  
  
1.  Create and configure the new resource pools and workload groups. Assign each workload group to the appropriate resource pool.  
  
    ```  
    --- Create a resource pool for production processing  
    --- and set limits.  
    USE master  
    GO  
    CREATE RESOURCE POOL pProductionProcessing  
    WITH  
    (  
         MAX_CPU_PERCENT = 100,  
         MIN_CPU_PERCENT = 50  
    )  
    GO  
    --- Create a workload group for production processing  
    --- and configure the relative importance.  
    CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP gProductionProcessing  
    WITH  
    (  
         IMPORTANCE = MEDIUM  
    )  
    --- Assign the workload group to the production processing  
    --- resource pool.  
    USING pProductionProcessing  
    GO  
    --- Create a resource pool for off-hours processing  
    --- and set limits.  
  
    CREATE RESOURCE POOL pOffHoursProcessing  
    WITH  
    (  
         MAX_CPU_PERCENT = 50,  
         MIN_CPU_PERCENT = 0  
    )  
    GO  
    --- Create a workload group for off-hours processing  
    --- and configure the relative importance.  
    CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP gOffHoursProcessing  
    WITH  
    (  
         IMPORTANCE = LOW  
    )  
    --- Assign the workload group to the off-hours processing  
    --- resource pool.  
    USING pOffHoursProcessing  
    GO  
    ```  
  
2.  Update the in-memory configuration.  
  
    ```  
    ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE  
    GO  
    ```  
  
3.  Create a table and define the start and end times for the production processing time range.  
  
    ```  
    USE master  
    GO  
    CREATE TABLE tblClassificationTimeTable  
    (  
         strGroupName     sysname          not null,  
         tStartTime       time              not null,  
         tEndTime         time              not null  
    )  
    GO  
    --- Add time values that the classifier will use to  
    --- determine the workload group for a session.  
    INSERT into tblClassificationTimeTable VALUES('gProductionProcessing', '6:35 AM', '6:15 PM')  
    go  
    ```  
  
4.  Create the classifier function that uses time functions and values that can be evaluated against the times in the lookup table. For information about using Lookup Tables in a classifier function, see “Best practices for using Lookup Tables in a classifier function” in this topic.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] introduced an expanded set of date and time data types and functions. For more information, see [Date and Time Data Types and Functions &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/functions/date-and-time-data-types-and-functions-transact-sql.md).  
  
    ```  
    CREATE FUNCTION fnTimeClassifier()  
    RETURNS sysname  
    WITH SCHEMABINDING  
    AS  
    BEGIN  
         DECLARE @strGroup sysname  
         DECLARE @loginTime time  
         SET @loginTime = CONVERT(time,GETDATE())  
         SELECT TOP 1 @strGroup = strGroupName  
              FROM dbo.tblClassificationTimeTable  
              WHERE tStartTime <= @loginTime and tEndTime >= @loginTime  
         IF(@strGroup is not null)  
         BEGIN  
              RETURN @strGroup  
         END  
    --- Use the default workload group if there is no match  
    --- on the lookup.  
         RETURN N'gOffHoursProcessing'  
    END  
    GO  
    ```  
  
5.  Register the classifier function and update the in-memory configuration.  
  
    ```  
    ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR with (CLASSIFIER_FUNCTION = dbo.fnTimeClassifier)  
    ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE  
    GO  
    ```  
  
### To verify the resource pools, workload groups, and the classifier user-defined function  
  
1.  Obtain the resource pool and workload group configuration by using the following query.  
  
    ```  
    USE master  
    SELECT * FROM sys.resource_governor_resource_pools  
    SELECT * FROM sys.resource_governor_workload_groups  
    GO  
    ```  
  
2.  Verify that the classifier function exists and is enabled by using the following queries.  
  
    ```  
    --- Get the classifier function Id and state (enabled).  
    SELECT * FROM sys.resource_governor_configuration  
    GO  
    --- Get the classifer function name and the name of the schema  
    --- that it is bound to.  
    SELECT   
          object_schema_name(classifier_function_id) AS [schema_name],  
          object_name(classifier_function_id) AS [function_name]  
    FROM sys.dm_resource_governor_configuration  
  
    ```  
  
3.  Obtain the current runtime data for the resource pools and workload groups by using the following query.  
  
    ```  
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_resource_governor_resource_pools  
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_resource_governor_workload_groups  
    GO  
    ```  
  
4.  Find out what sessions are in each group by using the following query.  
  
    ```  
    SELECT s.group_id, CAST(g.name as nvarchar(20)), s.session_id, s.login_time, CAST(s.host_name as nvarchar(20)), CAST(s.program_name AS nvarchar(20))  
              FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions s  
         INNER JOIN sys.dm_resource_governor_workload_groups g  
              ON g.group_id = s.group_id  
    ORDER BY g.name  
    GO  
    ```  
  
5.  Find out which requests are in each group by using the following query.  
  
    ```  
    SELECT r.group_id, g.name, r.status, r.session_id, r.request_id, r.start_time, r.command, r.sql_handle, t.text   
               FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r  
         INNER JOIN sys.dm_resource_governor_workload_groups g  
                ON g.group_id = r.group_id  
         CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) AS t  
    ORDER BY g.name  
    GO  
    ```  
  
6.  Find out what requests are running in the classifier by using the following query.  
  
    ```  
    SELECT s.group_id, g.name, s.session_id, s.login_time, s.host_name, s.program_name   
               FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions s  
         INNER JOIN sys.dm_resource_governor_workload_groups g  
               ON g.group_id = s.group_id  
                     AND 'preconnect' = s.status  
    ORDER BY g.name  
    GO  
  
    SELECT r.group_id, g.name, r.status, r.session_id, r.request_id, r.start_time, r.command, r.sql_handle, t.text   
               FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r  
         INNER JOIN sys.dm_resource_governor_workload_groups g  
               ON g.group_id = r.group_id  
                     AND 'preconnect' = r.status  
         CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) AS t  
    ORDER BY g.name  
    GO  
    ```  
  
### Best practices for using Lookup Tables in a classifier function  
  
1.  Do not use a lookup table unless it is absolutely necessary. If you need to use a lookup table, it can be hard coded into the function itself; however, this needs to be balanced with the complexity and dynamic changes of the classifier function.  
  
2.  Limit the I/O performed for lookup tables.  
  
    1.  Use the TOP 1 to return only one row.  
  
    2.  Minimize the number of rows in the table.  
  
    3.  Make all rows of the table exist on a single page, or a small number of pages.  
  
    4.  Confirm that rows found using the Index Seek operations use as many seeking columns as possible.  
  
    5.  De-normalize to a single table if you are considering using multiple tables with joins.  
  
3.  Prevent blocking on the lookup table.  
  
    1.  Use the `NOLOCK` hint to prevent blocking or use `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT` in the function with a maximum value of 1000 milliseconds.  
  
    2.  Table(s) must exist in the master database. (The master database is the only database that is guaranteed to be recovered when the client computers attempt to connect).  
  
    3.  Always fully-qualify the table name with the schema. The database name is not necessary since it has to be the master database.  
  
    4.  No triggers on the table.  
  
    5.  If you are updating the table contents, make sure to use a snapshot isolation level transaction to prevent Writer blocking Readers. Note that using the `NOLOCK` hint should also mitigate this.  
  
    6.  If possible, disable the classifier function when changing the table contents.
