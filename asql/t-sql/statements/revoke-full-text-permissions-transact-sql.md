# REVOKE Full-Text Permissions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../../relational-databases/import-export/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Revokes permissions on a full-text catalog or full-text stoplist.

|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [current version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299658)), [!INCLUDE[sqldbesa](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sqldbesa-md.md)].|

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
REVOKE [ GRANT OPTION FOR ] permission [ ,...n ] ON  
    FULLTEXT   
        {  
           CATALOG :: full-text_catalog_name  
           |  
           STOPLIST :: full-text_stoplist_name  
        }  
    { TO | FROM } database_principal [ ,...n ]  
    [ CASCADE ]  
    [ AS revoking_principal ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 GRANT OPTION FOR  
 Indicates that the right to grant the specified permission to other principals will be revoked. The permission itself will not be revoked.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If the principal has the specified permission without the GRANT option, the permission itself will be revoked.  
  
 *permission*  
 Is the name of a permission. The valid mappings of permissions to securables are described in the "Remarks" section, later in this topic.  
  
 ON FULLTEXT CATALOG **::***full-text_catalog_name*  
 Specifies the full-text catalog on which the permission is being revoked. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 ON FULLTEXT STOPLIST **::***full-text_stoplist_name*  
 Specifies the full-text stoplist on which the permission is being revoked. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal from which the permission is being revoked. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being revoked is also revoked from other principals to which it has been granted by this principal.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  A cascaded revocation of a permission granted WITH GRANT OPTION will revoke both GRANT and DENY of that permission.  
  
 AS *revoking_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to revoke the permission. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
## Remarks  
  
## FULLTEXT CATALOG Permissions  
 A full-text catalog is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be revoked on a full-text catalog are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Full-text catalog permission|Implied by full-text catalog permission|Implied by database permission|  
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY FULLTEXT CATALOG|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## FULLTEXT STOPLIST Permissions  
 A full-text stoplist is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be revoked on a full-text stoplist are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Full-text stoplist permission|Implied by full-text stoplist permission|Implied by database permission|  
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY FULLTEXT CATALOG|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the full-text catalog.
