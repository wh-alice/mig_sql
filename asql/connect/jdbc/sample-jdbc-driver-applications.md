# Sample JDBC Driver Applications
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../connect/jdbc/includes)]

  The Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server sample applications demonstrate various features of the JDBC driver. Additionally, they demonstrate good programming practices that you can follow when using the JDBC driver with a SQL Server database.  
  
 All the sample applications are contained in *.java code files that can be compiled and run on your local computer, and they are located in various subfolders in the following location:  
  
 \<*installation directory*>\sqljdbc_\<*version*>\\<*language*>\samples  
  
 The topics in this section describe how to configure and run the sample applications, and include a discussion of what the sample applications demonstrate.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Connecting and Retrieving Data](../../connect/jdbc/connecting-and-retrieving-data.md)|These sample applications demonstrate how to connect to a SQL Server database. They also demonstrate different ways in which to retrieve data from a SQL Server database.|  
|[Working with Data Types &#40;JDBC&#41;](../../connect/jdbc/working-with-data-types--jdbc-.md)|These sample applications demonstrate how to use the JDBC driver data type methods to work with data in a SQL Server database.|  
|[Working with Result Sets](../../connect/jdbc/working-with-result-sets.md)|These sample applications demonstrate how to use result sets to process data contained in a SQL Server database.|  
|[Working with Large Data](../../connect/jdbc/working-with-large-data.md)|These sample applications demonstrate how to use adaptive buffering to retrieve large-value data from a SQL Server database without the overhead of server cursors.|
