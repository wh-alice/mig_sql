# SQL Server Data Types in the .NET Framework
  The **SqlTypes** library is part of the base class library of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/tutorials/includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework. It is designed to provide data types with the same semantics and precision as those found in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database. This topic describes the new semantics to .NET Framework programmers, and introduces the types implemented in the **System.Data.SqlTypes** namespace that is included in the **System.Data** library.  
  
 This following table lists the topics in this section.  
  
 [Nullability and Three-Value Logic Comparisons](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-types-net-framework/nullability-and-three-value-logic-comparisons.md)  
 Discusses how NULL values are handled with common language runtime (CLR) integration data types.  
  
 [Collation and CLR Integration Data Types](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-types-net-framework/collation-and-clr-integration-data-types.md)  
 Describes how collations are handled with CLR integration.  
  
 [Handling Large Object &#40;LOB&#41; Parameters in the CLR](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-types-net-framework/handling-large-object-lob-parameters-in-the-clr.md)  
 Describes how to pass LOB types between [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and the CLR.  
  
 [Mapping CLR Parameter Data](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-types-net-framework/mapping-clr-parameter-data.md)  
 Shows data type mappings between [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], CLR integration, and the .NET Framework.
