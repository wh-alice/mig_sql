# Column Length Distribution Profile Request Options (Data Profiling Task)
  Use the **Request Properties** pane of the **Profile Requests** page to set the options for the **Column Length Distribution Profile Request** selected in the requests pane. A Column Length Distribution profile reports all the distinct lengths of string values in the selected column and the percentage of rows in the table that each length represents. This profile can help you identify problems in your data such as invalid values. For example, you profile a column of two-character United States state codes and discover values longer than two characters.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The options described in this topic appear on the **Profile Requests page** of the **Data Profiling Task Editor**. For more information about this page of the editor, see [Data Profiling Task Editor &#40;Profile Requests Page&#41;](../../integration-services/control-flow/data-profiling-task-editor-profile-requests-page.md).  
  
 For more information about how to use the Data Profiling Task, see [Setup of the Data Profiling Task](../../integration-services/control-flow/setup-of-the-data-profiling-task.md). For more information about how to use the Data Profile Viewer to analyze the output of the Data Profiling Task, see [Data Profile Viewer](../../integration-services/control-flow/data-profile-viewer.md).
