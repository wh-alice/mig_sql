# Lesson 4-1 - Copying the Lesson 3 Package
In this task, you will create a copy of the Lesson 3.dtsx package that you created in Lesson 3. Alternatively, if you did not complete lesson 3, you can add the completed lesson 3 package that is included with the tutorial to the project, and then make a copy of it to work with. You will use this new copy throughout the rest of Lesson 4.

5.  In Solution Explorer, double-click **Lesson 4.dtsx** to open the package.  
  
6.  Right-click anywhere in the background of the **Control Flow** tab and click **Properties**.  
  
7.  In the Properties window, update the **Name** property to **Lesson 4**.  
  
8.  Click the box for the **ID** property, and then in the list, click **<Generate New ID>**.  
  
### To add the completed Lesson 3 package  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] and open the SSIS Tutorial project.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click **SSIS Packages**, and click **Add Existing Package**.  
  
3.  In the **Add Copy of Existing Package** dialog box, in **Package location**, select **File system**.  
  
4.  Click the browse **(â€¦)** button, navigate to Lesson 3.dtsx on your machine, and then click **Open**.  
  
    To download all of the lesson packages for this tutorial, do the following.
