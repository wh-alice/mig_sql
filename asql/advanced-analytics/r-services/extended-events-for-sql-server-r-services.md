# Extended Events for SQL Server R Services
  [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-productname-md.md)] provides a set of extended events to use in troubleshooting operations related to the [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)] or R jobs sent to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 To view a list of events related to SQL Server, run the following query from [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
```  
select o.name as event_name, o.description  
  from sys.dm_xe_objects o  
  join sys.dm_xe_packages p  
    on o.package_guid = p.guid  
 where o.object_type = 'event'  
   and p.name = 'SQLSatellite';  
```  
  
 However, some additional extended events for [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-productname-md.md)] are fired only from external processes, such as the [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)], and BXLServer, the satellite process that starts the R runtime. For more information about how to capture these events, see [Collecting Events from External Processes](#bkmk_externalevents).  
  
 For general information about using extended events, see [SQL Server Extended Events Sessions](../../relational-databases/extended-events/sql-server-extended-events-sessions.md).  

  
##  <a name="bkmk_xeventtable"></a> Table of  Extended Events  
  
|Event|Description|Use|  
|-----------|-----------------|---------|  
|connection_accept|Occurs when a new connection is accepted. This event serves to log all connection attempts.||  
|failed_launching|Launching failed.|Indicates an error.|  
|satellite_abort_connection|Abort connection record||  
|satellite_abort_received|Fires when an abort message is received over a satellite connection.||

###  <a name="bkmk_externalevents"></a> Collecting Events from External Processes  
 [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-productname-md.md)] starts  some services that run outside of the SQL Server process. To capture events related to these external processes, you must create an events trace  configuration file and place the file in the same directory as the executable for the process.  
  
-   **[!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)]**   
  
     To capture events related to the Launchpad, place the *.config* file in the Binn directory for the SQL Server instance.  In a default installation, this would be:
      `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL_version_number.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn`.  
  
-   **BXLServer** is the satellite process that supports SQL extensibility with R and other external script languages.  
  
     To capture events related to BXLServer, place the *.config* file in the R installation directory.  In a default installation, this would be:
      `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL_version_number.MSSQLSERVER\R_SERVICES\library\RevoScaleR\rxLibs\x64`.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>   The configuration file must be named the same as the executable, using the format “[name].xevents.xml”. In other words, the files must be named as follows:  
>   
> - Launchpad.xevents.xml  
> - bxlserver.xevents.xml  
  
 The configuration file itself has the following format:  
  
```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<event_sessions>  
<event_session name="[session name]" maxMemory="1" dispatchLatency="1" MaxDispatchLatency="2 SECONDS">  
    <description owner="you">Xevent for launchpad or bxl server.</description>  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="[XEvent Name 1]" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="[XEvent Name 2]" />  
    <target package="package0" name="event_file">  
      <parameter name="filename" value="[SessionName].xel" />  
      <parameter name="max_file_size" value="10" />  
      <parameter name="max_rollover_files" value="10" />  
    </target>  
  </event_session>  
</event_sessions>  
  
```  
  
 **Notes:**  
  
-   To configure the trace, edit the *session name* placeholder, the placeholder for the filename (`[SessionName].xel`), and the names of the events you want to capture (such as `[XEvent Name 1]`, `[XEvent Name 1]`).  
  
-   Any number of `event package` tags may appear, and will be collected as long as the name attribute is correct.  
  
### Example: Capturing Launchpad events  
 The following example shows the definition of an event trace for the Launchpad service.  
  
```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<event_sessions>  
<event_session name="sqlsatelliteut" maxMemory="1" dispatchLatency="1" MaxDispatchLatency="2 SECONDS">  
    <description owner="hay">Xevent for sql tdd runner.</description>  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="launchpad_launch_start" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="launchpad_resume_sent" />  
    <target package="package0" name="event_file">  
      <parameter name="filename" value="launchpad_session.xel" />  
      <parameter name="max_file_size" value="10" />  
      <parameter name="max_rollover_files" value="10" />  
    </target>  
  </event_session>  
</event_sessions>  
  
```  
  
 **Notes:**  
  
-   Place the *.config* file in the Binn directory for the SQL Server instance.  
  
-   This file must be named *Launchpad.xevents.xml*.  
  
### Example: Capturing BXLServer events  
 The following example shows the definition of an event trace for the BXLServer executable.  
  
```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<event_sessions>  
 <event_session name="sqlsatelliteut" maxMemory="1" dispatchLatency="1" MaxDispatchLatency="2 SECONDS">  
    <description owner="hay">Xevent for sql tdd runner.</description>  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_abort_received" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_authentication_completion" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_cleanup" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_data_receive_completion" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_data_send_completion" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_data_send_start" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_schema_sent" />   
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_unexpected_message_received" />    
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_data_chunk_sent" />   
    <target package="package0" name="event_file">  
      <parameter name="filename" value="satellite_session.xel" />  
      <parameter name="max_file_size" value="10" />  
      <parameter name="max_rollover_files" value="10" />  
    </target>  
  </event_session>  
</event_sessions>  
  
```  
  
 **Notes:**  
  
-   Place the *.config* file in the same directory as the BXLServer executable.  
  
-   This file must be named *bxlserver.xevents.xml*.
