# Enable TDE on SQL Server Using EKM
  This topic describes how to enable transparent data encryption (TDE) in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/sscurrent-md.md)] to protect a database encryption key by using an asymmetric key stored in an extensible key management (EKM) module with [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)].  
  
 TDE encrypts the storage of an entire database by using a symmetric key called the database encryption key. The database encryption key can also be protected using a certificate which is protected by the database master key of the master database. For more information about protecting the database encryption key by using the database master key, see [Transparent Data Encryption &#40;TDE&#41;](../../../relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption-tde.md). For information about configuring TDE when [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running on an Azure VM, see [Extensible Key Management Using Azure Key Vault &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../relational-databases/security/encryption/extensible-key-management-using-azure-key-vault-sql-server.md). For information about configuring TDE using a key in the Azure key vault, see [Use SQL Server Connector with SQL Encryption Features](../../../relational-databases/security/encryption/use-sql-server-connector-with-sql-encryption-features.md). 

  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   You must be a high privileged user (such as a system administrator) to create a database encryption key and encrypt a database. That user must be able to be authenticated by the EKM module.  
  
-   Upon start up the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] must open the database. To do this, you should create a credential that will be authenticated by the EKM, and add it to a login that is based on an asymmetric key. Users cannot login using that login, but the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] will be able to authenticate itself with the EKM device.  
  
-   If the asymmetric key stored in the EKM module is lost, the database will not be able to be opened by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. If the EKM provider lets you back up the asymmetric key, you should create a back up and store it in a secure location.  
  
-   The options and parameters required by your EKM provider can differ from what is provided in the code example below. For more information, see your EKM provider.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 This topic uses the following permissions:  
  
-   To change a configuration option and run the RECONFIGURE statement, you must be granted the ALTER SETTINGS server-level permission. The ALTER SETTINGS permission is implicitly held by the **sysadmin** and **serveradmin** fixed server roles.  
  
-   Requires ALTER ANY CREDENTIAL permission.  
  
-   Requires ALTER ANY LOGIN permission.  
  
-   Requires CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY permission.  
  
-   Requires CONTROL permission on the database to encrypt the database.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To enable TDE using EKM  
  
1.  Copy the files supplied by the EKM provider to an appropriate location on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] computer. In this example, we use the **C:\EKM** folder.  
  
2.  Install certificates to the computer as required by your EKM provider.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not supply an EKM provider. Each EKM provider can have different procedures for installing, configuring and authorizing users.  Consult your EKM provider documentation to complete this step.  
  
3.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
4.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
5.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- Enable advanced options.  
    sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1 ;  
    GO  
    RECONFIGURE ;  
    GO  
    -- Enable EKM provider  
    sp_configure 'EKM provider enabled', 1 ;  
    GO  
    RECONFIGURE ;  
    GO  
    -- Create a cryptographic provider, which we have chosen to call "EKM_Prov," based on an EKM provider  
  
    CREATE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER EKM_Prov   
    FROM FILE = 'C:\EKM_Files\KeyProvFile.dll' ;  
    GO  
  
    -- Create a credential that will be used by system administrators.  
    CREATE CREDENTIAL sa_ekm_tde_cred   
    WITH IDENTITY = 'Identity1',   
    SECRET = 'q*gtev$0u#D1v'   
    FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER EKM_Prov ;  
    GO  
  
    -- Add the credential to a high privileged user such as your   
    -- own domain login in the format [DOMAIN\login].  
    ALTER LOGIN Contoso\Mary  
    ADD CREDENTIAL sa_ekm_tde_cred ;  
    GO  
    -- create an asymmetric key stored inside the EKM provider  
    USE master ;  
    GO  
    CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY ekm_login_key   
    FROM PROVIDER [EKM_Prov]  
    WITH ALGORITHM = RSA_512,  
    PROVIDER_KEY_NAME = 'SQL_Server_Key' ;  
    GO  
  
    -- Create a credential that will be used by the Database Engine.  
    CREATE CREDENTIAL ekm_tde_cred   
    WITH IDENTITY = 'Identity2'   
    , SECRET = 'jeksi84&sLksi01@s'   
    FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER EKM_Prov ;  
  
    -- Add a login used by TDE, and add the new credential to the login.  
    CREATE LOGIN EKM_Login   
    FROM ASYMMETRIC KEY ekm_login_key ;  
    GO  
    ALTER LOGIN EKM_Login   
    ADD CREDENTIAL ekm_tde_cred ;  
    GO  
  
    -- Create the database encryption key that will be used for TDE.  
    USE AdventureWorks2012 ;  
    GO  
    CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY  
    WITH ALGORITHM  = AES_128  
    ENCRYPTION BY SERVER ASYMMETRIC KEY ekm_login_key ;  
    GO  
  
    -- Alter the database to enable transparent data encryption.  
    ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2012   
    SET ENCRYPTION ON ;  
    GO  
    ```
