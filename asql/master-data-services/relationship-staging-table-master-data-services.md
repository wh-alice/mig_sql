# Relationship Staging Table (Master Data Services)
  Use the relationship staging table (stg.name_Relationship) in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../a9notintoc/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database to change the location of members in an explicit hierarchy, based on the relationship the members have to one another.  
  
##  <a name="TableColumns"></a> Table Columns  
 The following table explains what each of the fields in the Relationship staging table are used for.
