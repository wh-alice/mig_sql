# Color Coding in Query Editors
  The text entered in the code editors is assigned a category; each category is identified by a color. The colors help you quickly find text in your code. For example, comments stand out in dark green. The following table lists the most common colors. You can view the whole list of colors and their categories, and configure a custom color scheme by using the **Tools**, **Options** menu. For more information about how to change the default colors, see [Change Font Color, Size, and Style](../../relational-databases/scripting/change-font-color-size-and-style.md).  
  
## Default Code Colors  
  
|Color|Category|  
|-----------|--------------|  
|Red|SQL string|  
|Dark green|Comment|  
|Black on silver background|SQLCMD command|  
|Magenta|System function|  
|Green|System table, view, or table-valued function. Also, the system schemas sys and INFORMATION_SCHEMA.|  
|Blue|Keyword|  
|Teal|Line numbers or template parameter|  
|Maroon|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] stored procedure|  
|Dark gray|Operators|  
  
## Status Bar  
 You can configure registered servers or [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] servers in Object Explorer to have different colors in the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssde-md.md)] Query Editor status bar. This helps you identify which server each editor window is connected to when you have many windows open at the same time. For more information about setting status bar colors, see [Status Bar &#40;Database Engine Query Editor&#41;](../../relational-databases/scripting/status-bar-database-engine-query-editor.md).  
  
 Some types of editors do not display the status bar, or do not support multiple colors.
