# sp_lock (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Reports information about locks.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)] To obtain information about locks in the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], use the [sys.dm_tran_locks](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-dynamic-management-views/sys.dm-tran-locks-transact-sql.md) dynamic management view.  
  
||  
|-|  
|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [current version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299658)).|  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../../database-engine/configure/windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_lock [ [ @spid1 = ] 'session ID1' ] [ , [@spid2 = ] 'session ID2' ]  
[ ; ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@spid1 =** ] **'***session ID1***'**  
 Is a [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] session ID  number from **sys.dm_exec_sessions** for which the user wants locking information. *session ID1* is **int** with a default value of NULL. Execute **sp_who** to obtain process information about the session. If *session ID1* is not specified, information about all locks is displayed.  
  
 [ **@spid2 =** ] **'***session ID2***'**  
 Is another [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] session ID number from **sys.dm_exec_sessions** that might have a lock at the same time as *session ID1* and about which the user also wants information. *session ID2* is **int** with a default value of NULL.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 0 (success)  
  
## Result Sets  
 The **sp_lock** result set contains one row for each lock held by the sessions specified in the **@spid1** and **@spid2** parameters. If neither **@spid1** nor **@spid2** is specified, the result set reports the locks for all sessions currently active in the instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**spid**|**smallint**|The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] session ID number for the process requesting the lock.|  
|**dbid**|**smallint**|The identification number of the database in which the lock is held. You can use the DB_NAME() function to identify the database.|  
|**ObjId**|**int**|The identification number of the object on which the lock is held. You can use the OBJECT_NAME() function in the related database to identify the object. A value of 99 is a special case that indicates a lock on one of the system pages used to record the allocation of pages in a database.|  
|**IndId**|**smallint**|The identification number of the index on which the lock is held.|  
|**Type**|**nchar(4)**|The lock type:<br /><br /> RID = Lock on a single row in a table identified by a row identifier (RID).<br /><br /> KEY = Lock within an index that protects a range of keys in serializable transactions.<br /><br /> PAG = Lock on a data or index page.<br /><br /> EXT = Lock on an extent.<br /><br /> TAB = Lock on an entire table, including all data and indexes.<br /><br /> DB = Lock on a database.<br /><br /> FIL = Lock on a database file.<br /><br /> APP = Lock on an application-specified resource.<br /><br /> MD = Locks on metadata, or catalog information.<br /><br /> HBT = Lock on a heap or B-Tree index. This information is incomplete in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].<br /><br /> AU = Lock on an allocation unit. This information is incomplete in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|  
|**Resource**|**nchar(32)**|The value identifying the resource that is locked. The format of the value depends on the type of resource identified in the **Type** column:<br /><br /> **Type** Value: **Resource** Value<br /><br /> RID: An identifier in the format fileid:pagenumber:rid, where fileid identifies the file containing the page, pagenumber identifies the page containing the row, and rid identifies the specific row on the page. fileid matches the **file_id** column in the **sys.database_files** catalog view.<br /><br /> KEY: A hexadecimal number used internally by the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)].<br /><br /> PAG: A number in the format fileid:pagenumber, where fileid identifies the file containing the page, and pagenumber identifies the page.<br /><br /> EXT: A number identifying the first page in the extent. The number is in the format fileid:pagenumber.<br /><br /> TAB: No information provided because the table is already identified in the **ObjId** column.<br /><br /> DB: No information provided because the database is already identified in the **dbid** column.<br /><br /> FIL: The identifier of the file, which matches the **file_id** column in the **sys.database_files** catalog view.<br /><br /> APP: An identifier unique to the application resource being locked. In the format DbPrincipleId:\<first two to 16 characters of the resource string>\<hashed value>.<br /><br /> MD: varies by resource type. For more information, see the description of the **resource_description** column in [sys.dm_tran_locks &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/reference/system-dynamic-management-views/sys.dm-tran-locks-transact-sql.md).<br /><br /> HBT: No information provided. Use the **sys.dm_tran_locks** dynamic management view instead.<br /><br /> AU: No information provided. Use the **sys.dm_tran_locks** dynamic management view instead.|  
|**Mode**|**nvarchar(8)**|The lock mode requested. Can be:<br /><br /> NULL = No access is granted to the resource. Serves as a placeholder.<br /><br /> Sch-S = Schema stability. Ensures that a schema element, such as a table or index, is not dropped while any session holds a schema stability lock on the schema element.<br /><br /> Sch-M = Schema modification. Must be held by any session that wants to change the schema of the specified resource. Ensures that no other sessions are referencing the indicated object.<br /><br /> S = Shared. The holding session is granted shared access to the resource.<br /><br /> U = Update. Indicates an update lock acquired on resources that may eventually be updated. It is used to prevent a common form of deadlock that occurs when multiple sessions lock resources for potential update at a later time.<br /><br /> X = Exclusive. The holding session is granted exclusive access to the resource.<br /><br /> IS = Intent Shared. Indicates the intention to place S locks on some subordinate resource in the lock hierarchy.<br /><br /> IU = Intent Update. Indicates the intention to place U locks on some subordinate resource in the lock hierarchy.<br /><br /> IX = Intent Exclusive. Indicates the intention to place X locks on some subordinate resource in the lock hierarchy.<br /><br /> SIU = Shared Intent Update. Indicates shared access to a resource with the intent of acquiring update locks on subordinate resources in the lock hierarchy.<br /><br /> SIX = Shared Intent Exclusive. Indicates shared access to a resource with the intent of acquiring exclusive locks on subordinate resources in the lock hierarchy.<br /><br /> UIX = Update Intent Exclusive. Indicates an update lock hold on a resource with the intent of acquiring exclusive locks on subordinate resources in the lock hierarchy.<br /><br /> BU = Bulk Update. Used by bulk operations.<br /><br /> RangeS_S = Shared Key-Range and Shared Resource lock. Indicates serializable range scan.<br /><br /> RangeS_U = Shared Key-Range and Update Resource lock. Indicates serializable update scan.<br /><br /> RangeI_N = Insert Key-Range and Null Resource lock. Used to test ranges before inserting a new key into an index.<br /><br /> RangeI_S = Key-Range Conversion lock. Created by an overlap of RangeI_N and S locks.<br /><br /> RangeI_U = Key-Range Conversion lock created by an overlap of RangeI_N and U locks.<br /><br /> RangeI_X = Key-Range Conversion lock created by an overlap of RangeI_N and X locks.<br /><br /> RangeX_S = Key-Range Conversion lock created by an overlap of RangeI_N and RangeS_S. locks.<br /><br /> RangeX_U = Key-Range Conversion lock created by an overlap of RangeI_N and RangeS_U locks.<br /><br /> RangeX_X = Exclusive Key-Range and Exclusive Resource lock. This is a conversion lock used when updating a key in a range.|  
|**Status**|**nvarchar(5)**|The lock request status:<br /><br /> CNVRT: The lock is being converted from another mode, but the conversion is blocked by another process holding a lock with a conflicting mode.<br /><br /> GRANT: The lock was obtained.<br /><br /> WAIT: The lock is blocked by another process holding a lock with a conflicting mode.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Users can control the locking of read operations by:  
  
-   Using SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL to specify the level of locking for a session. For syntax and restrictions, see [SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../t-sql/statements/set-transaction-isolation-level-transact-sql.md).  
  
-   Using locking table hints to specify the level of locking for an individual reference of a table in a FROM clause. For syntax and restrictions, see [Table Hints &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-table.md).  
  
 All distributed transactions not associated with a session are orphaned transactions. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)] assigns all orphaned distributed transactions the SPID value of -2, which makes it easier for a user to identify blocking distributed transactions. For more information, see [Use Marked Transactions to Recover Related Databases Consistently &#40;Full Recovery Model&#41;](../../../relational-databases/backup-restore/use-marked-transactions-to-recover-related-databases-consistently.md).  
  
## Permissions
