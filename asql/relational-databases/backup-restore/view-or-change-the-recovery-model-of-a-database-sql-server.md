# View or Change the Recovery Model of a Database (SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../../database-engine/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This topic describes how to view or change the database by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)]. 
  
  A *recovery model* is a database property that controls how transactions are logged, whether the transaction log requires (and allows) backing up, and what kinds of restore operations are available. Three recovery models exist: simple, full, and bulk-logged. Typically, a database uses the full recovery model or simple recovery model. A database can be switched to another recovery model at any time. The **model** database sets the default recovery model of new databases.  
  
  For a more in depth explanation of [recovery models](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189275.aspx), see [SQL Server Recovery Models](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertutorial/2/sql-server-recovery-models/) provided by the folks at [MSSQLTips!](https://www.mssqltips.com/)
  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before you begin  
  

-   [Back up the transaction log](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms179478.aspx) **before** switching from the [full recovery or bulk-logged recovery model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189275.aspx).  
  
-   Point-in-time recovery is not possible with bulk-logged model. Running transactions under the bulk-logged recovery model that require a transaction log restore can exposed them to data loss. To maximize data recoverability in a disaster-recovery scenario, switch to the bulk-logged recovery model only under the following conditions:  
  
    -   Users are currently not allowed in the database.  
  
    -   All modifications made during bulk processing are recoverable without depending on taking a log backup; for example, by re-running the bulk processes.  
  
     If you satisfy these two conditions, you will not be exposed to any data loss while restoring a transaction log that was backed up under the bulk-logged recovery model..  
  
**Note!** If you switch to the full recovery model during a bulk operation, bulk operations logging changes from minimal logging to full logging, and vice versa.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Required permissions  
   Requires ALTER permission on the database.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To view or change the recovery model  
  
1.  After connecting to the appropriate instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], in Object Explorer, click the server name to expand the server tree.  
  
2.  Expand **Databases**, and, depending on the database, either select a user database or expand **System Databases** and select a system database.  
  
3.  Right-click the database, and then click **Properties**, which opens the **Database Properties** dialog box.  
  
4.  In the **Select a page** pane, click **Options**.  
  
5.  The current recovery model is displayed in the **Recovery model** list box.  
  
6.  Optionally, to change the recovery model select a different model list. The choices are **Full**, **Bulk-logged**, or **Simple**.  
  
7.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To view the recovery model  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**. This example shows how to query the [sys.databases](../../relational-databases/reference/system-catalog-views/sys.databases-transact-sql.md) catalog view to learn the recovery model of the **model** database.  
  
```tsql  
SELECT name, recovery_model_desc  
   FROM sys.databases  
      WHERE name = 'model' ;  
GO  
  
```  
  
#### To change the recovery model  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../analysis-services/instances/install/windows/includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**. This example shows how to change the recovery model in the `model` database to `FULL` by using the `SET RECOVERY` option of the [ALTER DATABASE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-set-options.md) statement.  
  
```tsql  
USE master ;  
ALTER DATABASE model SET RECOVERY FULL ;  
```  
  
##  <a name="FollowUp"></a> Recommendations: After you change the recovery model  
  
-   **After switching between the full and bulk-logged recovery models**  
  
    -   After completing the bulk operations, immediately switch back to full recovery mode.  
  
    -   After switching from the bulk-logged recovery model back to the full recovery model, back up the log.  
  
        >**NOTE:** Your backup strategy remains the same: continue performing periodic database, log, and differential backups.  
  
-   **After switching from the simple recovery model**  
  
    -   Immediately after switching to the full recovery model or bulk-logged recovery model, take a full or differential database backup to start the log chain.  
  
        >**NOTE:** The switch to the full or bulk-logged recovery model takes effect only after the first data backup.  
  
    -   Schedule regular log backups, and update your restore plan accordingly.  
  
        > **IMPORTANT!!!!** Back up your logs!! If you do not back up the log frequently enough, the transaction log can expand until it runs out of disk space!  
  
-   **After switching to the simple recovery model**  
  
    -   Discontinue any scheduled jobs for backing up the transaction log.  
  
    -   Ensure periodic database backups are scheduled. Backing up your database is essential both to protect your data and to truncate the inactive portion of the transaction log.
