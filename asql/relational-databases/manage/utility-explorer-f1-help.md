# Utility Explorer F1 Help
  The following sections document [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility functionality and associated operations.  
  
  ## Utility Dashboard (SQL Server Utility)
 To see data in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility dashboard, select the top node in the Utility Explorer tree - labeled "Utility<UCP_Name>\\(ComputerName\UCP)." The dashboard includes summary and detail data from all managed instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and all data-tier applications in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility. To refresh data in the dashboard, right-click the top node in the Utility Explorer tree, and select **Refresh**.  
  
 For more information about how to create a utility control point, see [Create a SQL Server Utility Control Point &#40;SQL Server Utility&#41;](../../relational-databases/manage/create-a-sql-server-utility-control-point-sql-server-utility.md). For more information about how to add an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility, see [Enroll an Instance of SQL Server &#40;SQL Server Utility&#41;](../../relational-databases/manage/enroll-an-instance-of-sql-server-sql-server-utility.md).  
 
  
### UIElement List  
 Managed Instance Health  
 Health status for managed instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is displayed on the left side of the Utility Explorer content pane.  
  
 Managed Instance Health parameters are as follows:  
  
-   CPU utilization for the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   Database file utilization.  
  
-   Storage volume space utilization.  
  
-   CPU utilization for the computer.  
  
-   Status for each parameter is divided into three categories:  
  
-   Well-utilized - Number of managed instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] which are not violating resource utilization policies.  
  
-   Underutilized - Number of managed resources which are violating resource underutilization policies.  
  
-   Overutilized - Number of managed resources which are violating resource overutilization policies.  
  
-   No Data Available - Data is not available for managed instances of SQL Server either because the instance of SQL Server has just been enrolled and the first data collection operation has not completed, or because there is a problem with the managed instance of SQL Server collecting and uploading data to the UCP.  
  
 Detailed status for each health parameter is listed in sliding indicators. The fraction to the right of the sliding indicators shows how many managed instances are in each status category.  
  
 To create a filtered view of a managed instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or a data-tier application, click on the link for a utilization category next to its sliding indicator in the Utility dashboard. For example, if you click on **Overutilized Instance CPU** in the **Utility Explorer Content** pane, SSMS creates a filtered list view of managed instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that have overutilized CPU based on current policy settings.  
  
 Notice that when you click on a link for a utilization category, the corresponding node in the Utility Explorer navigation pane is appended with **(filtered)** - that is, **Managed Instances** is labeled **Managed Instances (filtered)**. To view filter settings, right-click on the node in the navigation pane and select **Filter**, then click on **Filter Settings**. To clear filter settings, right-click on the node in the navigation pane and select **Filter**, then click on **Remove Filter**.  
  
 For more information about viewing health status for individual instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], or to view or change policy configuration settings, see [Managed Instance Details &#40;SQL Server Utility&#41;](../../a9retired/managed-instance-details-sql-server-utility.md).  
  
 Utility Summary  
 Displays the number of managed instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and the number of data-tier applications managed by the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility.  
  
 Data-tier Application Health  
 Health status for data-tier applications is displayed on the right side of the Utility Explorer content pane.  
  
 Data-tier Application Health parameters are as follows:  
  
-   CPU utilization for the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   Database file utilization.  
  
-   Storage volume space utilization.  
  
-   CPU utilization for the computer.  
  
 Status for each parameter is divided into three categories:  
  
-   Well-utilized - Number of data-tier applications which are not violating resource utilization policies.  
  
-   Overutilized - Number of data-tier applications which are violating resource overutilization policies.  
  
-   Underutilized - Number of data-tier applications which are violating resource underutilization policies.  
  
-   No Data Available - Data is not available for data-tier applications because the managed instance of SQL Server that contains the data-tier application is not reporting data.  
  
 Detailed status for each health parameter is listed in sliding indicators. The fraction to the right of the sliding indicators shows how many data-tier applications are in each status category. For more information about viewing health status for individual data-tier applications, or to view or change policy configuration settings, see [Deployed Data-tier Application Details &#40;SQL Server Utility&#41;](../../a9retired/deployed-data-tier-application-details-sql-server-utility.md).  
  
 Utility Storage Utilization History  
 Utilization history is shown in a time graph at the bottom of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility dashboard. Note that time data show the UCP local date and time using the datetime data type. For more information, see the [datetime (Transact-SQL)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=164071) topic. When using the Utility object model, note that SSMS uses the datetimeoffset data type. For more information, see the [datetimeoffset (Transact-SQL)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=141713) topic.  
  
 Use the radio buttons to the left of the display area to change the reporting period for the graph.  
  
 Options for the reporting interval are:  
  
-   1 Day, displayed in 15-minute intervals.

-   1 Month, displayed in 1-week intervals.  
  
-   1 Year, displayed in 1-month intervals.  
  
 After you make a change to the reporting interval, the data refreshes automatically.  
  
 Utility Storage Utilization  
 In the bottom right of the dashboard, the storage utilization pie chart displays the ratio of used space to free space on volumes residing on computers that contain managed instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Data for this display are refreshed every 15 minutes.  
 
 ## Deployed Data-tier Application Details (SQL Server Utility)
  Information in the Deployed Data-tier Applications view of Utility Explorer provides utilization data for individual data-tier applications, CPU utilization history, storage utilization details at the file level, and the ability to view and update policy thresholds.

 To view files by volume, select the **Volume** radio button in the **Group files by:** selection. The graph of storage utilization history displays file space used by all data files and all log files on the storage volume. Expand the tree to view details for individual database data files and log files.  
  
 Status icons are used to provide status for each volume:  
  
-   Green check - Resources are well-utilized.  
  
-   Green down arrow - Resources are underutilized.  
  
-   Red up arrow - Resources are overutilized.  
  
 The gauge next to each file name on the Storage Utilization tab represents the amount of space used by the file relative to the effective capacity of the file. The percentage value displayed next to the gauge is the ratio of the amount of space used by the file relative to the effective capacity of the file. Tool tips provide data used to calculate percentages for each volume and each file compared to effective capacity.  
  
 If the file is not configured to auto-grow, then the effective capacity is the amount of space allocated to the file. If the file is configured to auto-grow, then the effective capacity is the sum of the amount of space currently allocated to the file and the amount of free space currently available on the volume.  
  
 Storage utilization policies can be configured for data files and for log files. To view or change the storage utilization policy thresholds for files, click on the **File Policy** link at the bottom of the Storage Utilization pane. To view or change the storage utilization policy thresholds for a storage volume, click on the **Volume Policy** link at the bottom of the Storage Utilization pane.  
  
 To override the default policy thresholds, click on the radio button to **Override the default policy**, specify values for the upper and lower limits, then click **OK**.
