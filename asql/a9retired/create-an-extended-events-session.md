# Create an Extended Events Session
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2014-asdb-xxxx-xxx_md](../a9retired/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2014-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  You can create an Extended Events session by using the Query Editor, or you can create a session in Object Explorer. In Object Explorer, Extended Events provides two user interfaces you can use to create, modify, and view event session data â€” a wizard that guides you through the event session creation process, and a New Session UI that provides more advanced configuration options. You can create Extended Events sessions to diagnose SQL Server tracing, which enables you to resolve issues such as the following:  
  
-   Find your most expensive queries  
  
-   Find root causes of latch contention  
  
-   Find a query that is blocking other queries  
  
-   Troubleshoot excessive CPU usage caused by query recompilation  
  
-   Troubleshoot deadlocks
