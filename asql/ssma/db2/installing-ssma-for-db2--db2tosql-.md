# Installing SSMA for DB2 (DB2ToSQL)
SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for DB2 consists of a client application that you use to perform a migration from DB2 to SQL Server and Azure SQL DB. It also contains an extension pack that supports data migration and the use of DB2 system functions in your migrated databases.  
  
You install the client application on the computer from which you will perform the migration steps. The extension pack is deployed by the client and does not require a separate install.  
  
## Upgrading SSMA for DB2  
If you want to upgrade to a later version of SSMA for DB2, you must first uninstall the client and the server extension pack, and then install the newer version.
