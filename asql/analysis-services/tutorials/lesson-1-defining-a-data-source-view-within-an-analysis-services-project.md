# Lesson 1: Defining a Data Source View within an Analysis Services Project
Designing a business intelligence application in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] starts with creating an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. Within this project, you define all the elements of your solution, starting with a data source view.  
  
This lesson contains the following tasks:  
  
[Creating an Analysis Services Project](../../analysis-services/tutorials/lesson-1-1-creating-an-analysis-services-project.md)  
In this task, you create the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Tutorial project, based on an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] multidimensional model template.  
  
[Defining a Data Source](../../analysis-services/tutorials/lesson-1-2-defining-a-data-source.md)  
In this task, you specify the **AdventureWorksDW2012** database as the data source for the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] dimensions and cubes that you will define in subsequent lessons.  
  
[Defining a Data Source View](../../analysis-services/tutorials/lesson-1-3-defining-a-data-source-view.md)  
In this task, you define a single unified view of the metadata from selected tables in the **AdventureWorksDW2012** database.  
  
[Modifying Default Table Names](../../analysis-services/tutorials/lesson-1-4-modifying-default-table-names.md)  
In this task, you modify table names in the data source view, so that the names of subsequent [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../a9notintoc/includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] objects that you define will be more user-friendly.  
  
Compare your results against a sample project file that was built for this lesson.
