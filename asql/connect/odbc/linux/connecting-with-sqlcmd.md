# Connecting with sqlcmd
[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../../connect/odbc/linux/includes)]

The [sqlcmd](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=154481) utility is available in the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server on Linux.  
  
The following commands show first how to use Windows Authentication and second, how to use SQL Server Authentication.  
  
```  
sqlcmd –E –Sxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  
sqlcmd –Sxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx –Uxxx -Pxxx  
```  
  
## sqlcmd Options that are Available  
In the current release, the following sqlcmd options are available:  
  
-?  
Display sqlcmd usage.  
  
-a  
Request a packet size.  
  
-b  
Terminate batch job if there is an error.  
  
-c *batch_terminator*  
Specify the batch terminator.  
  
-C  
Trust server certificate.  
  
-d *database_name*  
Issue a USE *database_name* statement when you start sqlcmd.  
  
-D  
Causes the value passed to the sqlcmd -S option to be interpreted as a data source name (DSN). For more information, see "DSN Support in sqlcmd and bcp" at the end of this topic.  
  
-e  
Write input scripts to the standard output device (stdout).  
  
-E  
Use trusted connection, integrated authentication.

-h *number_of_rows*  
Specify the number of rows to print between the column headings.  
  
-H  
Specify a workstation name.  
  
-i *input_file*[,*input_file*[,…]]  
Identify the file that contains a batch of SQL statements or stored procedures.  
  
-I  
Set the SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER connection option to ON.  
  
-k  
Remove or replace control characters.  
  
**-K***application_intent*  
Declares the application workload type when connecting to a server. The only currently supported value is **ReadOnly**. If **-K** is not specified, sqlcmd does not support connectivity to a secondary replica in an AlwaysOn availability group. For more information, see [ODBC Driver on Linux Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](../../../connect/odbc/linux/odbc-driver-on-linux-support-for-high-availability--disaster-recovery.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> **-K** is not supported in the CTP for SUSE Linux. You can, however, specify the **ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly** keyword in a DSN file passed to sqlcmd. For more information, see "DSN Support in sqlcmd and bcp" at the end of this topic.  
  
-l  
Specify the number of seconds before a sqlcmd login to the ODBC driver times out when you try to connect to a server.  
  
-m *error_level*  
Control which error messages are sent to stdout.  
  
**-M***multisubnet_failover*  
Always specify **-M** when connecting to the availability group listener of a SQL Server 2012 availability group or a SQL Server 2012 Failover Cluster Instance. **-M** provides for faster detection of and connection to the (currently) active server. If **–M** is not specified, **-M** is off. For more information about AlwaysOn Availability Groups, see [ODBC Driver on Linux Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](../../../connect/odbc/linux/odbc-driver-on-linux-support-for-high-availability--disaster-recovery.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> **-M** is not supported in the CTP for SUSE Linux. You can, however, specify the **MultiSubnetFailover=Yes** keyword in a DSN file passed to sqlcmd. For more information, see "DSN Support in sqlcmd and bcp" at the end of this topic.  
  
-N  
Encrypt connection.  
  
-o *output_file*  
Identify the file that receives output from sqlcmd.  
  
-p  
Print performance statistics for every result set.  
  
-P  
Specify a user password.  
  
-q *commandline_query*  
Execute a query when sqlcmd starts, but does not exit sqlcmd when the query has finished running.  
  
-Q *commandline_query*  
Execute a query when sqlcmd starts. sqlcmd will exit when the query finishes.  
  
-r  
Redirects error messages to stderr.  
  
-R  
Causes the driver to use client regional settings to convert currency and date and time data to character data. Currently only uses en_US (US English) formatting.  
  
-s *column_separator_char*  
Specify the column-separator character.  
  
-S [*protocol*:] *server*[**,***port*]  
Specify the instance of SQL Server to which to connect. Or, if -D is used, a DSN. The ODBC driver on Linux requires -S. For the ODBC driver on Linux, **tcp** is the only valid protocol.  
  
-t *query_timeout*  
Specify the number of seconds before a command (or SQL statement) times out.  
  
-u  
Specify that output_file is stored in Unicode format, regardless of the format of input_file.  
  
-U *login_id*  
Specify a user login ID.  
  
-V *error_severity_level*  
Control the severity level that is used to set the ERRORLEVEL variable.  
  
-w *column_width*  
Specify the screen width for output.  
  
-W  
Remove trailing spaces from a column.  
  
-x  
Disable variable substitution.  
  
-X  
Disable commands, startup script, and environment variables.  
  
-y *variable_length_type_display_width*  
Set the sqlcmd scripting variable SQLCMDMAXFIXEDTYPEWIDTH.  
  
-Y *fixed_length_type_display_width*  
Set the sqlcmd scripting variable SQLCMDMAXVARTYPEWIDTH.  
  
In the current release, the following sqlcmd commands are available:  
  
-   [:]!!  
  
-   :Connect  
  
-   :Error  
  
-   [:]EXIT  
  
-   GO [*count*]  
  
-   :Help  
  
-   :List  
  
-   :Listvar  
  
-   :On Error  
  
-   :Out  
  
-   :Perftrace  
  
-   [:]QUIT  
  
-   :r  
  
-   :RESET  
  
-   :setvar  
  
## sqlcmd Options that are Not Available  
In the current release, the following sqlcmd options are not available:  
  
-A  
Log in to SQL Server with a Dedicated Administrator Connection (DAC). For information on how to make a dedicated administrator connection (DAC), see [Programming Guidelines](../../../connect/odbc/linux/programming-guidelines.md).  
  
-f *code_page*  
Specify the input and output code pages.  
  
-L  
List the locally configured server computers, and the names of the server computers that are broadcasting on the network.  
  
-v  
Create a sqlcmd scripting variable that can be used in a sqlcmd script.  
  
You can use the following alternative method:  
  
-   Put the parameters inside one file. Which you can then append to another file. This will help you use a parameter file to replace the values. Create a file called a.sql (the parameter file) with the following content:  
  
    ```  
    :setvar ColumnName object_id  
    :setvar TableName sys.objects  
    ```  
  
-   Create a file called b.sql,with the parameters for replacement:  
  
    ```  
    select $(ColumnName) from $(TableName)  
    ```  
  
-   At the command line, combine a.sql and b.sql into c.sql, using the following commands:  
  
    cat a.sql > c.sql  
  
    cat b.sql >> c.sql  
  
-   Run sqlcmd and use c.sql as input file:  
  
    slqcmd -S\<…> -P\<..> –U\<..> -I c.sql  
  
-z *password*  
Change password.  
  
-Z *password*  
Change password and exit.  
  
In the current release, the following sqlcmd commands are not available:  
  
-   :ED  
  
-   :ServerList  
  
-   :XML  
  
## DSN Support in sqlcmd and bcp  
You can specify a data source name (DSN) instead of a server name in the **sqlcmd** or **bcp-S** option (or **sqlcmd** :Connect command) if you specify -D. -D causes the -S option to retrieve the specified DSN. **sqlcmd** or **bcp** connect to the server specified in the DSN.  
  
System DSNs are stored in the odbc.ini file in the ODBC SysConfigDir directory (/etc/odbc.ini on standard installations). User DSNs are stored in .odbc.ini in a user's home directory (~/.odbc.ini).  
  
The following entries are supported in a DSN on Linux:  
  
-   **ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly**  
  
-   **Database=***database_name*  
  
-   **Driver=ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server**  
  
-   **MultiSubnetFailover=Yes**  
  
-   **Server=***server_name_or_IP_address*  
  
-   **Trusted_Connection=yes**|**no**  
  
In a DSN, only the DRIVER entry is required, but to connect to a server, **sqlcmd** or **bcp** need the value in the SERVER entry.  
  
If the same option is specified in both the DSN and the **sqlcmd** or **bcp** command line, the **sqlcmd** or **bcp** option override the value used in the DSN. For example, if the DSN has a DATABASE entry and the **sqlcmd** command line includes -d, the value passed to **-d** is used. If **Trusted_Connection=yes** is specified in the DSN, Kerberos authentication is used, and user name (**–U**) and password (**–P**) , if provided, is ignored.  
  
Existing scripts that invoke **isql** can be modified to use **sqlcmd** by defining the following alias: **alias isql="sqlcmd –D"**.
