# Tutorial: Creating a Free Form Report (Report Builder)
In this tutorial, you create a paginated report that acts as a newsletter. Each page displays static text, summary visuals, and detailed sample sales data.

![report-builder-free-form-report-complete](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-free-form-report-complete.png)

The report groups information by territory and displays the name of the sales manager for the territory as well as detailed and summary sales information. You start with a list data region as the foundation for the free form report, then add a decorative panel with an image, static text with data inserted, a table to show detailed information, and optionally, pie and column charts to display summary information.  
  
Estimated time to complete this tutorial: 20 minutes.  
  
## Requirements  
For more information about requirements, see [Prerequisites for Tutorials &#40;Report Builder&#41;](../../reporting-services/tutorials/prerequisites-for-tutorials-report-builder.md).  
  
## <a name="BlankReport"></a>1. Create a Blank Report, Data Source, and Dataset  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> In this tutorial, the query contains the data values so that it does not need an external data source. This makes the query quite long. In a business environment, a query would not contain the data. This is for learning purposes only.  
  
### To create a blank report  
  
1.  [Start Report Builder](../../reporting-services/report-builder/start-report-builder.md) either from your computer, the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] web portal, or SharePoint integrated mode.  
  
    The **New Report or Dataset** dialog box opens.  
  
    If you don't see the **New Report or Dataset** dialog box, on the **File** menu > **New**.  
  
2.  In the left pane, make sure **New Report** is selected. 
 
3.  In the right pane, click **Blank Report**.  
  
### To create a new data source  
  
1.  In the Report Data pane, click **New** > **Data Source**.  
  
2.  In the **Name** box, type: **ListDataSource**  
  
3.  Click **Use a connection embedded in my report**.  
  
4.  Verify that the connection type is Microsoft SQL Server, and then in the **Connection string** box type: **Data Source = \<servername>**  
  
    **\<servername>**, for example Report001, specifies a computer on which an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine is installed. Because the data for this report is not extracted from a SQL Server database, you need not include the name of a database. The default database on the specified server is just used to parse the query.  
  
5.  Click **Credentials**, and enter the credentials needed to connect to the instance of the SQL Server Database Engine.  
  
6.  Click **OK**.  
  
### To create a new dataset  
  
1.  In the Report Data pane, click **New** > **Dataset**.  
  
2.  In the **Name** box, type: **ListDataset**.  
  
3.  Click **Use a dataset embedded in my report**, and verify that the data source is **ListDataSource**.  
  
4.  Verify that the **Text** query type is selected, and then click **Query Designer**.  
  
5.  Click **Edit as Text**.  
  
6.  Copy and paste the following query into the query pane:  
  
    ```  
    SELECT CAST('2009-01-05' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Lauren Johnson' as FullName,'Central' as Territory, 'Accessories' as Subcategory,'Carrying Case' as Product, CAST(16996.60 AS money) AS Sales, 68 as Quantity

    ```  
  
7.  Click the **Run** icon (!) to run the query.  
  
    The query results are the data available to display in your report.  
  
    ![report-builder-free-form-tutorial-data](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-free-form-tutorial-data.png) 
  
8.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
## <a name="List"></a>2. Add and Configure a List  
In [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] the list data region is ideal for creating free-form reports. It's based on the *tablix* data region, as are tables and matrixes. For more information, see [Create Invoices and Forms with Lists](../../reporting-services/report-design/create-invoices-and-forms-with-lists-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
You will use a list to display the sales information for sales territories in a report formatted like a newsletter. The information is grouped by territory. You will add a new row group that groups data by territory, and then delete the built-in Details row group.  
  
### To add a list  
  
1.  On the **Insert** tab > **Data Regions** > **List**. 

2. Click in the report body (between the title and footer areas) and drag to make the list box. Make the list box 7 inches tall and 6.25 inches wide. To get the exact size, in the **Properties** pane under **Position**, type values for the **Width** and **Height** properties.
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > This report uses the paper size Letter (8.5 X11) and 1 inch margins. A list box taller than 9 inches or wider than 6.5 inches might generate blank pages.  
  
2.  Click inside the list box, right-click the bar at the top of the list, and click **Tablix Properties**.  
  
    ![report-builder-free-form-tablix-properties](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-free-form-tablix-properties.png) 
  
3.  In the **Dataset name** drop-down list, select **ListDataset**.  
  
4.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
5.  Right-click inside the list, and then click **Rectangle Properties**.  
  
6.  On the **General** tab, select the **Add a page break after** check box.  
  
7.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
### To add a new row group and to delete the Details group  
  
1.  In the Row Groups pane, right-click the Details group, point to **Add Group**, and then click **Parent Group**.  
  
    ![report-builder-free-form-add-parent-group](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-free-form-add-parent-group.png)  
  
2.  In the **Group by** list, select `[Territory].`  
  
3.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
    A column containing the cell `[Territory]` is added to the list.
  
4.  Right-click the Territory column in the list, and then click **Delete Columns**.  
  
    ![report-builder-free-form-delete-columns](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-free-form-delete-columns.png)
  
5.  Select **Delete Columns only**.  
  
6.  In the Row Groups pane, right-click the **Details** group > **Delete Group**.  
   
7.  Select **Delete Group only**.  
  
8.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
## <a name="Graphics"></a>3. Add Graphic elements  
One advantage of list data regions is that you can add report items such as rectangles and text boxes anywhere, instead of being limited to a tabular layout. You will enhance the appearance of the report by adding a graphic (a rectangle filled with a color).  
  
### To add graphic elements to the report  
  
1.  On the **Insert** tab, select **Rectangle**. 

2. Click in the the upper left corner of the list and drag to make the rectangle 7 inches tall and 3.5 inches wide. Again, to get the exact size, in the **Properties** pane under **Position**, type values for **Width** and **Height**.
  
2.  Right-click the rectangle > **Rectangle Properties**.  
  
3.  Click the **Fill** tab.  
  
4.  In **Fill color**, select **Light Gray**.  
   
5.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
6.  Click **Run** to preview the report.  
  
The left side of the report now has vertical graphic that consists of a light gray rectangle, as shown in the following image.  
  
![report-builder-free-form-gray-rectangle](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-free-form-gray-rectangle.png)
 
## <a name="Text"></a>4. Add Free Form Text  
You can add text boxes to display static text that is repeated on each report page, as well as data fields.  
  
### To add text to the report  
  
1.  Click **Design** to return to design view.  
  
2.  On the **Insert** tab > **Text Box**. Click the upper left corner of the list,  inside of the rectangle you added previously, and drag to make the text box about 3.45 inches wide and 5 inches tall.  
  
3.  With the cursor in the text box and type: **Newsletter for** . Include a space after the word "for", to separate the text from the field you will add in the next step.   
  
    ![Add newsletter heading text](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/tutorial-newsletterfor.png "Add newsletter heading text")  
  
4.  Drag the `[Territory]` field from ListDataSet in the Report Data pane to the text box and place it after "Newsletter for ".  
  
    ![report-builder-free-form-territory-field](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-free-form-territory-field.png)
  
5.  Select the text and the `[Territory]` field.  
  
6.  On the **Home** tab > **Font**, select: 
  
    *  **Segoe Semibold**.
    *  **20 pt**.
    *  **Tomato**.  
  
9. Place the cursor below the text you typed in step 3 and type: **Hello** with a space after the word, to separate the text and the field that you will add in the next step.  
 
10. Drag the `[FullName]` field from ListDataSet in the Report Data pane to the text box and place it after "Hello ", then type a comma (,).  
   
11. Select the text you added in the previous steps.
  
12. On the **Home** tab > **Font**, select: 
  
    *  **Segoe Semibold**.
    *  **16 pt**.
    *  **Black**.  
   
15. Place the cursor below the text you added in steps 9 through 13, and then copy and paste the following meaningless text:  
  
    ```  
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin sed dolor in ipsum pulvinar egestas. Sed sed lacus at leo ornare ultricies. Vivamus velit risus, euismod nec sodales gravida, gravida in dui. Etiam ullamcorper elit vitae justo fermentum ut ullamcorper augue sodales. 
    Ut placerat, nisl quis feugiat adipiscing, nibh est aliquet est, mollis faucibus mauris lectus quis arcu. In mollis tincidunt lacinia. In vitae erat ut lorem tincidunt luctus. Curabitur et magna nunc, sit amet adipiscing nisi. Nulla rhoncus elementum orci nec tincidunt. 
    Aliquam imperdiet cursus erat vel tincidunt. Donec et neque ac urna rutrum sodales. In id purus et nisl dignissim dapibus. Sed rhoncus metus at felis feugiat eu tempor dolor vehicula. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam faucibus consectetur diam eu pellentesque.   
 
    ```  
  
16. Select the text you just added.  
  
17.  On the **Home** tab > **Font**, select: 
  
      *  **Segoe UI**.
      *  **10 pt**.
      *  **Black**.  
 
20. Place the cursor inside the text box, below the meaningless text and type: **Congratulations on your total sales of**, with a space after the word to separate the text and the field you will add in the next step. 
  
21. Drag the Sales field to the text box, place it after the text you typed in the previous step, then type an exclamation mark (!).  

25. Select the text and the field you just added.  
  
17.  On the **Home** tab > **Font**, select: 
  
      *  **Segoe Semibold**.
      *  **16 pt**.
      *  **Black**.  
  
22. Select just the `[Sales]` field, right-click the field > **Expression**.  
  
23. In the **Expression** box, change the expression to include the Sum function as follows:  
  
    ```  
    =Sum(Fields!Sales.value)  
    ```  
  
24. [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../analysis-services/data-mining/includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
    ![report-builder-free-form-text-box](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-free-form-text-box.png)
 
29. With `[Sum(Sales)]` still selected, on the **Home** tab > **Number** group > **Currency**.  
  
30. Right-click the text box with the "Click to add title" text, and then click **Delete**.  
  
31. Select the list box. Select the two double-headed arrows and move it to the top of the page.  

    ![report-builder-drag-list](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-drag-list.png)
  
32. Click **Run** to preview the report.  
  
The report displays static text and each report page includes data that pertains to a territory. Sales are formatted as currency.  
  
![report-builder-newsletter-page-preview](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-newsletter-page-preview.png)
  
## <a name="Table"></a>5. Add a Table to Show Sales Details  
Use the New Table and Matrix Wizard to add a table to the free form report. After you complete the wizard, you will manually add a row for totals.  
  
### To add a table  
  
1.  On the **Insert** tab > **Data Regions** area > **Table** > **Table Wizard**.  
  
2.  On the **Choose a dataset** page, click **ListDataset** > **Next**.  
  
4.  On the **Arrange fields** page, drag the Product field from **Available fields** to **Values.**  
  
5.  Repeat step 3 for SalesDate, Quantity, and Sales. Place SalesDate below Product, Quantity below SalesDate, and Sales below SalesDate.  
  
6.  Click **Next**.  
  
7.  On the **Choose the layout** page, view the layout of the table.  
  
    The table is simple: five columns with no row or column groups. Because it has no groups, the layout options related to groups, are not available. You will manually update the table to include a total later in the tutorial.  
  
8.  Click **Next**.  
  
9. Click **Finish**.  
  
11. Drag the table to below the text box that you added in lesson 4.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Make sure the table is inside the list box and inside the gray rectangle.  
  
12. With the table selected, in the **Row Group** pane right-click **Details** > **Add Total** > **After**.  
  
    ![report-builder-free-form-table-totals](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-free-form-table-totals.png)
  
13. Select the cell in the Product column and type **Total**.

    ![report-builder-free-form-type-total](../../reporting-services/tutorials/media/report-builder-free-form-type-total.png)

12. Select the [SalesDate] field. On the **Home** tab > **Number**, change **Default** to **Date**.

13. Select the [Sum(Sales)] fields. On the **Home** tab > **Number**, change **Default** to **Currency**.

### To verify the charts are inside the rectangle  

You can use rectangles as containers for other items on a report page. Read more about [rectangles as containers](../../reporting-services/report-design/rectangles-and-lines-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).
  
1.  Select the rectangle you created and added the charts to, earlier in this lesson.  
  
    In the Properties pane, the **Name** property displays the name of the rectangle.

4.  Click the column chart and repeat step 3.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the charts are not inside the rectangle, the rendered report does not display the charts together.  
  
### To make the charts the same size  
  
1.  Select the pie chart, press the Ctrl key, and then select the column chart.  
  
2.  With both charts selected, right-click > **Layout** > **Make Same Width**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > The item you click first determines the width of all the selected items.  
  
3.  Click **Run** to preview the report.  
  
The report now displays summary sales data in pie and column charts.
