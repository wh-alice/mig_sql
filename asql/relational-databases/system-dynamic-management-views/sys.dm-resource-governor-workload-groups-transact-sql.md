# sys.dm_resource_governor_workload_groups (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-asdw-pdw_md](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

  Returns workload group statistics and the current in-memory configuration of the workload group. This view can be joined with sys.dm_resource_governor_resource_pools to get the resource pool name.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To call this from [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../database-engine/configure/windows/includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name **sys.dm_pdw_nodes_resource_governor_workload_groups**.

## Remarks  
 This dynamic management view shows the in-memory configuration. To see the stored configuration metadata, use the sys.resource_governor_workload_groups catalog view.  
  
 When ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RESET STATISTICS is successfully executed, the following counters are reset: statistics_start_time, total_request_count, total_queued_request_count, total_cpu_limit_violation_count, total_cpu_usage_ms, max_request_cpu_time_ms, total_lock_wait_count, total_lock_wait_time_ms, total_query_optimization_count, total_suboptimal_plan_generation_count, total_reduced_memgrant_count, and max_request_grant_memory_kb. statistics_start_time is set to the current system date and time, the other counters are set to zero (0).  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires VIEW SERVER STATE permission.
