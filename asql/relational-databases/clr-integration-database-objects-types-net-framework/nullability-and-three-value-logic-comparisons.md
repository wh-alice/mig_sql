# Nullability and Three-Value Logic Comparisons
  If you are familiar with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data types, you will find similar semantics and precision in the **System.Data.SqlTypes** namespace in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. There are some differences, however, and this topic covers the most important of these differences.  
  
## NULL Values  
 A primary difference between native common language runtime (CLR) data types and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data types is that the former do not allow for NULL values, while the latter provide full NULL semantics.  
  
 Comparisons are affected by NULL values. When comparing two values x and y, if either x or y is NULL, then some logical comparisons evaluate to an UNKNOWN value rather than true or false.  
  
## SqlBoolean Data Type  
 The **System.Data.SqlTypes** namespace introduces a **SqlBoolean** type to represent this 3-value logic. Comparisons between any **SqlTypes** return a **SqlBoolean** value type. The UNKNOWN value is represented by the null value of the **SqlBoolean** type. The properties **IsTrue**, **IsFalse**, and **IsNull** are provided to check the value of a **SqlBoolean** type.  
  
## Operations, Functions, and NULL Values  
 All arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, %), bitwise operators (~, &, and |), and most functions return NULL if any of the operands or arguments of **SqlTypes** are NULL. The **IsNull** property always returns a true or false value.  
  
## Precision  
 Decimal data types in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] CLR have different maximum values than those of the numeric and decimal data types in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. In addition, in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] CLR decimal data types assume the maximum precision. In the CLR for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], however, **SqlDecimal** provides the same maximum precision and scale, and the same semantics as the decimal data type in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Overflow Detection  
 In the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] CLR, the addition of two very large numbers may not throw an exception. Instead, if no check operator has been used, the returned result may "wrap around" as a negative integer. In **System.Data.SqlTypes**, exceptions are thrown for all overflow and underflow errors, and divide-by-zero errors.
