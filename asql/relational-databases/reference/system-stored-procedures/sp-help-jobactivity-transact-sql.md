## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_help_jobactivity { [ @job_id = ] job_id | [ @job_name = ] 'job_name' }  
     [ , [ @session_id = ] session_id ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@job_id =**] *job_id*  
 The job identification number. *job_id*is **uniqueidentifier**, with a default of NULL.  
  
 [ **@job_name =**] **'***job_name***'**  
 The name of the job. *job_name*is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Either *job_id* or *job_name* must be specified, but both cannot be specified.  
  
 [ **@session_id** = ] *session_id*

|**job_id**|**uniqueidentifier**|Identifier for the job.|  
|**job_name**|**sysname**|Name of the job.|  
|**run_requested_date**|**datetime**|When that the job was requested to run.|

|**queued_date**|**datetime**|When the request was queued. NULL if the job was run directly.|  
|**start_execution_date**|**datetime**|When the job was assigned to a runnable thread.|  
|**last_executed_step_id**|**int**|The step ID of the most recently run job step.|  
|**last_exectued_step_date**|**datetime**|The time that the most recently run job step started to run.|  
|**stop_execution_date**|**datetime**|The time that the job stopped running.|  
|**next_scheduled_run_date**|**datetime**|When the job is next scheduled to run.|  
|**job_history_id**|**int**|Identifier for the job history in the job history table.|

## Remarks  
 This procedure provides a snapshot of the current state of the jobs. The results returned represent information at the time that the request is processed.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent creates a session id each time that the Agent service starts. The session id is stored in the table **msdb.dbo.syssessions**.  
  
 When no *session_id* is provided, lists information about the most recent session.  
  
 When no *job_name* or *job_id* is provided, lists information for all jobs.  
  
## Permissions  
 By default, members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can run this stored procedure. Other users must be granted one of the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent fixed database roles in the **msdb** database:  
  
-   **SQLAgentUserRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentReaderRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentOperatorRole**  
  
 For details about the permissions of these roles, see [SQL Server Agent Fixed Database Roles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/719ce56b-d6b2-414a-88a8-f43b725ebc79).  
  
 Only members of **sysadmin** can view the activity for jobs owned by other users.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example lists activity for all jobs that the current user has permission to view.  
  
```  
USE msdb ;  
GO
