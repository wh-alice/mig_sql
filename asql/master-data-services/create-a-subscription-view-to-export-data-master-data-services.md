# Create a Subscription View to Export Data (Master Data Services)
  Create a subscription view to export Master Data Services data to subscribing systems. You're creating a view of your data in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../analysis-services/includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Integration Management** functional area. For more information, see [Functional Area Permissions &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/functional-area-permissions-master-data-services.md).  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To create and edit a subscription view  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../database-engine/install/windows/includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **Integration Management**.  
  
2.  From the menu bar, click **Create Views**.  
  
3.  On the **Subscription Views** page, click **Add** to create a view or click **Edit** to edit a view. A panel displays on the right side.  
  
4.  In the **Create Subscription View** pane, in the **Name** box, type a name for the view.  
  
     In the **Edit Subscription View** pane, in the **Name** box, type the updated name for the view.  
  
5.  From the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
6.  Select **Include soft-deleted members**, to include soft-deleted members in the view.  
  
7.  Select either **Version** or **Version Flag** in **Version Options**, and then select from the corresponding list.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  Create a subscription view based on a version flag. When you lock a version, you can reassign the flag to an open version without updating the subscription view.  
  
8.  Select either **Entity** or **Derived hierarchy** in the **Data Sources** option, and then select from the corresponding list.  
  
9. From the **Format** list, select a subscription view format.  
  
10. If you chose **Explicit levels** or **Derived levels** from the **Format** list, type the number of levels in the hierarchy to include in the view.  
  
11. Click **Save**.  
  
## View Information  
 For each created view, a row with ten columns is added to the grid. The following table describes the columns.  
  
|Column|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|Status|The view status.<br /><br /> When you click **Save**, the ![Icon for updating status](../master-data-services/media/mds-statusicon-updating.png "Icon for updating status") image displays, indicating that the view is updating.<br /><br /> If there are errors when creating or editing a view, the ![Icon for error status](../master-data-services/media/mds-statusicon-error.png "Icon for error status") image displays.<br /><br /> Otherwise, the status is OK and the ![Icon for OK status](../master-data-services/media/mds-statusicon-ok.png "Icon for OK status") image displays.|
