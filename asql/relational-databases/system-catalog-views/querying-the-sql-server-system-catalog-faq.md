## Answers  
  
###  <a name="_FAQ1"></a> How do I find all the tables that do not have a clustered index in a specified database?  
 Before you run the following queries, replace `<database_name>` with a valid database name.  
  
```  
SELECT SCHEMA_NAME(t.schema_id) AS schema_name, t.name AS table_name  
FROM sys.tables AS t  
WHERE NOT EXISTS   
   (  
     SELECT * FROM sys.indexes AS i  
     WHERE i.object_id = t.object_id  
     AND i.type = 1  -- or type_desc = 'CLUSTERED'  
   )  
ORDER BY schema_name, table_name;  
GO  
  
```  
  
 Or, you can use the `OBJECTPROPERTY` function as shown in the following example.  
  
```  
USE <database_name>;  
GO  
SELECT SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name, name AS table_name  
FROM sys.tables   
WHERE OBJECTPROPERTY(object_id,'TableHasClustIndex') = 0  
ORDER BY schema_id, name;  
GO  
  
```

###  <a name="_FAQ2"></a> How do I find all the owners of entities contained in a specified schema?

USE <database_name>;  
GO  
SELECT 'OBJECT' AS entity_type  
    ,USER_NAME(OBJECTPROPERTY(object_id, 'OwnerId')) AS owner_name  
    ,name   
FROM sys.objects WHERE SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) = '<schema_name>'  
UNION   
SELECT 'TYPE' AS entity_type  
    ,USER_NAME(TYPEPROPERTY(SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) + '.' + name, 'OwnerId')) AS owner_name  
    ,name   
FROM sys.types WHERE SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) = '<schema_name>'   
UNION  
SELECT 'XML SCHEMA COLLECTION' AS entity_type   
    ,COALESCE(USER_NAME(xsc.principal_id),USER_NAME(s.principal_id)) AS owner_name  
    ,xsc.name   
FROM sys.xml_schema_collections AS xsc JOIN sys.schemas AS s  
    ON s.schema_id = xsc.schema_id  
WHERE s.name = '<schema_name>';

    FROM sys.key_constraints   
    WHERE type_desc = 'PRIMARY_KEY_CONSTRAINT' -- or type = 'PK'  
    );  
GO  
  
```  
  
 Or, you can run the following query.  
  
```  
USE <database_name>;  
GO  
SELECT SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name  
    ,name AS table_name   
FROM sys.tables

ORDER BY schema_name, table_name;  
GO  
  
```  
  
 Or, you can run the following query.  
  
> [!NOTE]

```  
USE <database_name>;  
GO  
SELECT SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name

 Before you run the following query, replace `<database_name>` with a valid name and `<schema_name.data`_`type`\_`name>` with a valid, schema-qualified CLR user-defined type, or schema-qualified alias type name.

###  <a name="_FAQ26"></a> How do I find the views, Transact-SQL functions, and Transact-SQL stored procedures that depend on a specified CLR user-defined type or alias type?  
 Before you run the following query, replace `<database_name>` with a valid name and `<schema_name.data_type_name>` with a valid, schema-qualified CLR user-defined type, alias type name.  
  
 The parameters defined in a function or procedure are implicitly schema bound. Therefore, parameters that depend on a CLR user-defined type or alias type can be viewed by using the [sys.sql_dependencies](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys.sql-dependencies-transact-sql.md) catalog view. Procedures and triggers are not schema bound. This means that dependencies between any expression defined in the body of the procedure or trigger and a CLR user-defined type or alias type is not maintained. Schema bound views and schema bound user-defined functions that have expressions that depend on a CLR user-defined type or alias type are maintained in the **sys.sql_dependencies** catalog view. Dependencies between types and CLR functions and CLR procedures are not maintained.  
  
 The following query returns all schema-bound dependencies in views, [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] functions, and [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/includes/tsql-md.md)] stored procedures for a specified CLR user-defined type or alias type.
